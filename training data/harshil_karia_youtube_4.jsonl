            "content": "I mean let's actually start with your education how was your education experience I did uh I actually liked my education I did a bachelor of mass media I did 11th and 12th of the IB program so I was the one of the first kids in India Same by the way yeah to pass through the IB Program how much did you get 145 I'm not going to say it's okay it was it was something like 36 or something that's not too bad including Tok and uh the others uh I don't remember I I think back then we didn't have the to grade you just needed to go through 36 on 45 was my grade uh but yeah I was good and then after I did the IB then I decided to stay back in India uh I didn't go abroad to study um so I had to do a little bit of uh paperwork convincing the universities that this grade yeah it's legitimate Etc so finally it happened I did my bachelor of mass media so so what was your experience in IB like and how was it different from let's say your class 10 we probably did what ICC or c a whole whole world of difference so I think like Tok was a big game changer let's talk about to a little bit I mean people my audience does not know to yeah so to is IV's version of uh I mean I guess it's like free flowing philosophy theory of knowledge theory of knowledge so you break down uh you know really subjects which are like what is truth what is certainty what is uh you know like intelligence what is knowledge exactly you really learn how to break problems down but if I had to really sum it up what that taught me and I'd love to know your view also what that taught me is that uh it taught me the way to learn M so right from moving from like hey let's uh let's you know like let's MK this up uh we went into really understanding or learning a concept concept so I think that was the main thing if I had to take like distill the two years of IB that is what it taught me how to learn and the best part which I remember like my high point is that at the end of the two years uh I don't really value awards that much but I got an award that time which was called a lifetime learner award so that was a big deal for me it was like more than the award it was a signal okay you know just keep doing this uh and that was working for me what about you for no no very interesting yeah cuz I was in a boarding school right and I did ICC till class 10 and I did really well in ICC like 99% type well right and I was on top of the world and then I did IB in my grade 11 and grade 12 and in grade 11 I literally failed all of the six subjects oh in 11th right because we were so not used to being free when it comes to like learning right you were always told you know questions but in I they literally told us to write a 6,000 word extended ESS I like how do you write a four like I need more instructions you know tell me what to do in paragraph one tell me what to do in paragraph two yeah and we were completely like we were deers in front of a headlight you know we didn't know what to do but that's what I actually I enjoyed that the most because it was most challenging like I remember the first thing English higher level we had to study a book my first book was was the fine balance a fine balance Ro mystery and then you had to write an essay on Breaking the book down not what the book said but what it meant and like you know what were the themes what was not kind of explained in the book that you need to decipher so I really enjoyed that part uh I mean we had this book called the girl who can which was written by um the the the Finance Minister of Nigeria at the time ah right it was the stories it was 10 stories of Nigerian girls who had really broken stereotypes right and this is us sitting in dadun reading about Nigerian girls and breaking down the literature uh of Nigeria and and you know at one point I was thinking you know why am I doing this but as I was doing it I realized it's so rewarding I suddenly know everything there is to know about Nigeria and about the you know the stance of women there yeah and uh when I went to college later on and I I I got the chance to go to the US there I realized how important all of that you know where did you study I studied in this college called pen University of Pennsylvania nice yeah and uh and there upen upen upen yes and there you know we had classes like South American literature right where we had to talk and and we were learning history and geography and politics through literature yeah right and and that I remember there was a book on internment camps Japanese internment camps post World War II in the US yeah right and lit coming out of there and you know and it just tells you like you living such a small bubble the world is such exactly like through literature even I mean like The Quiet American was a book we studied which was about the Vietnam War and Americans in the Vietnam War so really understanding geopolitics through literature really understanding through economics how you can connect the dots to you know business uh you know how you can understand macroeconomics and then therefore understand business management better so just really connecting the dots was the fun part how you use that to build what you've built at Master's Union yeah know I mean when one of the courses I was partnered up with someone who later became my business partner his name is Randy Lebanese and he's someone who had basically been a refugee in Lebanon then moved to the US and grown up in the US uh changed like 17 schools in the process yeah uh and I realized that by virtue of him changing 17 schools across 17 different cities running from one city to the other fleeing not running yeah uh the perspective he had towards life was incredibly different yeah for him starting a company was not a risk he's like dud listen I have bombs falling on me every day yeah starting a company is not a risk defin of risk is totally yeah it's like know I mean like I mean if you you know we went swimming once and I could see there were like 18 different like marks on his body of like sharpel going inside and I like this guyy seen something and here's me like we don't understand the meaning of risk at all at all I think especially like people who grown up early '90s uh you know India we've been through a pretty decently good time I would say so we haven't really understood what risk me risk means in that sense or like you know what really pushing ourselves or going through trouble means I think it's different versions of troubles I mean I don't want to be little one trouble versus the other but uh but this is a different perspective tell me one thing uh it seems like literature was one of your I like literature you like literature I like literature is that what led you to to build your career in marketing kind of uh you know I mean what the the short story is that because I wasn't getting into any course uh the University of Mumbai said okay we'll let you get into a course if you crack an entrance exam okay and there was 36 on 50 average you know average of the class"

            "content": "social basically started with a large purpose of uniting the world uh so you know Mark Zak very early on he would give a lot of speeches about like the world as one Community correct uh what we then saw is the creation of micro communities and that was really interesting what nobody saw is the boom of influencers the way we are seeing right now I don't think Mark Zuckerberg back then predicted the growth of personal Brands and I'll tell you why the growth of personal Brands happened because actually between 2006 and 2013 it was the era of brands on social so you see the largest communities were Starbucks you know sure what have you so they were the largest communities like 2 million 3 million 5 million whatever companies basically companies were the largest communities communties and then and they were serving their own purpose they were serving their own purpose and the content started getting very repetitive sales and then came the individual who started doing outlandish things the algorithm then figured out that look actually we got to push individuals and if we push individuals we're going to have more stickiness uh and then that led to the explosion of influencers digital marketing then became a bit more how would I would say a bit more traditional so like digital marketing and social was a bit like the Wild Wild West for marketeers I give you one example like what marketeers used to love back in the day in between 2009 and 2013 what Market used to love is television you can only do a 30 second ad or a 15-second ad or 20 second ad marketers love the fact that you could get three minute space on YouTube so we did a lot of work like I did uh from Maybelline we launched this product Baby Lips where we had Alia bat put together a kiss song and it went viral and then we had done this uh you like this this amazing film about this young boy in a village somewhere in Maharashtra who basically used solar energy to he was catching fireflies to help his sister stud that correct correct cor and then uh you know then there was an initiative that Ghia had around lighting of villages so we did that so really the landscape was very very big suddenly all that went out of the window then you had the Advent of influences so digital marketing became more traditional in the sense that like you know the you TV TV and then digital yeah digital became the TV template which is that you do 30 seconders you do nice banners you do interactive and that's what you're now seeing with the Advent of CGI Etc uh you know the hyper the Maybelline eyelashes or like we had of course we had the uh you know the milk bickies on the cink or you know different different things with CGI so now you're seeing Brands becoming more interesting by doing actually behaving like content creators yeah uh so now that's where brands are now catching up yeah no no I think like every company has to become a media company at this point I mean we we look at Master's Union and I feel like my content budget is way way way more than my digital marketing budget and and over time it's I think U like I think we are a business school right and and we have no business being on YouTube and Instagram yeah yeah that's where we spent a lot of our time on yeah we I I mean I think our ad spends are like basically down to zero yeah but our content spends are now ballooning yeah but that also also depends on on the kind of company though like so for a master's Union I think it works that you are so heavy on content because people are basically going to come in and they're going to get convinced because of the content that that you will be bottom of the funnel yeah B bottom of the funnel is very very important whereas a lot of companies it's about physical and mental availability so that's where media planning still counts like if it's you're an fmcg product or you're a digital fmcg product fast you know you need to you need to maintain a certain amount of visibility and digital availability and uh you know mental avail such that I am on TV on India Pakistan because I am an Impulse product I am cadb I an Impulse product I on top of mind I need to be there and I'm available everywhere so the the trick to doing a marketing spend is if you want to do a heavy marketing spend you need to make sure that you are available everywhere of course if you're not available everywhere marketing money is a waste of money and because you guys are available in this one fantastic location and you basically now putting it here saying here's where the magic really happens so you're showing what the magic is and it's you know you are what you show and that's that's what people come and experience which is why the high NPS Etc got it understood makes makes a lot of sense so now uh you know we spoke about newspapers then TV happened then digital happened now you know it's a lot of it is influencer Leed marketing yeah of course CGI uh what's next like what are some of the trends that you're seeing early I think what we are seeing is uh I think we're seeing very interesting space where through the Advent of AI uh Brands and companies being able to really add genuine value to customers lives what do I mean by that so we're thinking of a campaign right now uh you know where with Happy D we've just launched a campaign where there is a lovely uh standup comedy show"

            "content": "which is only for people who cannot hear okay uh you know so it's a sign language based comedy and now what we've done is we're building an AI which is able to take up and convert any comedy video on the internet to a sign language video so your was seeing the ability of Brands to really permeate people's lives uh through through a tangible digital products I think also we are seeing now the world is a lot more technically sound so what do I mean by this world is a lot more technically sound right like back in the day 5 years back six years back to going back to the Happy Dent one what does happy Dent get out of that uh so it's what does happy Den get out of that I think I'll answer the question in two ways one is majority of sales of happy Dent happen through physical availability and mental availability so it has to advertise a lot and you know it's got a very high repeat rate but when you're a market leader and when you when you know your mission is to make people smile anything that you do okay which edges people to smile consistently even more it stays true to your brand purpose got it so the large companies are like really edging into purpose um and same thing I can take an example of britania you know like now but I just complete the earlier point about how uh you know now you have a world where companies can really build anything you know like building a digital product building a tech product is now quite fast it's quite ubiquitous you know product management skills are quite easily available technical skills are available there's a lot of no opportun exactly so uh earlier if you wanted to invest in something like that you're thinking of like something very very high in terms of budget now you're saying I'll park 2 and a half three crores for this and I can make something very meaningful for that uh another example I'll take is for britania you know so britania has a amazing product Mari which is used by millions of housewives in millions of homes so they are the ones who decide what to buy it the other thing that's happened now is that in India today every action that you take or every you know everything that you do dropping your kids to school uh you know coaching them uh mentally counseling them making food all of that has a price today on the internet so we're building what we call a housewife salary calculator and it's the first time in India that you can actually calculate you know we've seen lot of newspaper press that what is the what is the value of the GDP contribution of Housewives of a house but you don't have it today but now you have equivalent price of that so build a technology around that which goes on pack which goes everywhere uh you know so that is where I see the you know like the the early signs of where it's going and of course like where we are ultimately heading is if you see the scene from Minority Report where Tom Cruz is walking through mall and then everything is hyper personalized to him linked to you know what he ate yesterday to what he prefers to the way he looks so we're moving into an era of marketing which is very very tailor made and Hyper personalized so that is the that is where marketing is headed and I think the near immediate opportunities are to create real products and use uh use the technology at our disposal to create something interesting so I mean hyper personalization is one and then of course experiential Marketing in a way where the products actually adding value to you the marketing campaign is also adding value to you it's not just selling to you but it's doing something to you that um is first of all making you smile but also just adding improving your life in it's a master's Union version of marketing oh all right okay I look at it that I mean so I mean one of our marketing um tactics is essentially like our CC podcast yeah right and that's basically marketing for us but at the same time time we are educating our customers about you know various Industries even this podcast that we're doing right at the end of the day we want uh people to like learn more about you know what's happening in the industry at the same time we have this inside hook where we're trying to also sell our products yeah right uh which makes which makes a lot of sense um let's let's talk some more ideas so you know with respect to this I I think just one thing I want to put on the table which is that marketing like this there's a there's a lot of less opportunity for faf yeah so the course that we've created you know which is the shank Academy coming together with Master's Union to build this course in strategic marketing and AI U I think everything that we are talking about here people will get to experience in a much more detailed way in the course so what I like about this way of especially in you know this whole uh Information Age building this kind of content is is is definitely I think 100% if somebody does the course they're going to get significant value but even if they won't this adds some value to their lives and you know we give them a direction that people actually get value uh just by even listening to this podcast absolutely of course doing the course would be a lot more in detail makes um makes any other ideas that come to your mind where some campaigns have really added value to a customer are than just sold to them uh the one that I remember is uh multi- winner globally called share the load yeah of course you know aial share the load uh and where it provoked through a simple question around laundry what I loved about that campaign was that it's got a very very simple question is like should women do all the household laundry uh and it's not it's not asked the question very very like you know it's not campaigning but it's asked a question and then that question itself provoked a lot of people to spark a conversation and then what I loved also about that campaign is they went to many many different touch points so you know they had also tied up at one of the fashion weeks where they created inside the clothing they created wash care labels uh him washing and her washing things like that so you know where a campaign moves and leaves from just mass communication and looks at various different touch points that is where it becomes interesting this salary calculator is going to hit home yeah s calcor is going to hit home like it's it's one that we are building for international Awards uh because it will do that we we will have a film which will you know provoke the question then we will have the tech and then we will have you know very varations of this wash care label Etc so that's how we try to sit to build campaigns and that is how Marketing in the new world for large companies is going to be built because how can you tie in purpose which also links to an interesting message which people would be enjoying to watch and then how do you then take it across touch points such that they can be Amplified by influencers and the like because ultimately influencers to talk about brands also need something interesting to talk about and influencer can't just say hey here's a biscuit and this is what it is but if then influencer says a message which is very very interesting you're suddenly utilizing the influencer very well correct I mean so now let's talk about Talent right so you you have to deliver these campaigns you have to think of these campaigns you have probably hundreds of clients yeah so how do you build your team in a way that you can actually service your clients and do all of these things and get awards every year how does that how does that work"

            "content": "we have a pretty good recruitment uh engine we today about 1200 of us across our three cities and we've got two centers one in the ukuk now one recently we acquired a company in Amsterdam so we're building out I think for us the way we see Talent is that we think that the way it went in the early '90s is the age of creative Industries now so you know in our business just to take a step back you got wpp above the Masters Union campus you know wpp is a British origin company Omnicom is a US origin companyis is French uh digitas is part of Publis which is French uh you know Havas is French densu is Japanese there's no Indian company which is a global company with a presence everywhere and with the kind of Indian talent that you see with the expression of creativity that you see with the ability of Technology the ability of clarity to put strategy together we're building a hub in India and now with you know offices across the world where we can bring in business from across the world so we have a very simple Mission which is from India to the world and the best of the world to India and uh that is what U you know that is what is driving us now how do we how do we really build this Talent uh there's I mean people complain that it's a bit difficult to get into shebang and I'm okay with that because we've got a pretty rigorous recruitment process um one fast way to FasTrack that recruitment process is to get into internship so I know that 20 of the students who do the you know the Master's Union Shang Academy course are going to be on the floor right uh so we typically if they're well entrenched into Brands we able to make them an offer quickly um but also we have fairly rigorous uh you know kind of testing process um so we and and with each with each profile we got a different process so for example if you're taking a technology project manager then we've deliberately made sure that the test for the technology project manager is very very difficult uh you need to think a bit like a product manager and a project manager to be to do let's say I'm a bb or an MBA student today and I want to really get into marketing yeah right um what recommendation do you have for me the first thing we look at on the CV is we look at work which is outside of which is yeah which is which is basically what in advertising we call a portfolio so we look at your portfolio of work we look at if you've been able to get something viral if you if you are part of Master's Union and if you've done a video which is on their Channel which is crazy or a couple of videos which is crazy or you you know you've done something on the podcast and you've contributed to building the podcast you buildt an IP at Master's Union those are things that we will first look at which is immediately going to get our attention of course grades is a second layer where we look at the grades as well but the first thing which gets interest also like there's a big Trend right now creating spec ads so you create ads for companies or you create campaigns for companies which you don't have a brief of just by following what they do got it uh they're called spec ads yeah spec ads yeah or like uh if you are able to you know like and then some people are more strategic than creative so what I would highly recommend is that if you have if you know our clients like 15 of our clients and you read the annual reports and send us a summary that look this is what your clients are actually up to and this is the trick that you're missing that is going to get our attention so it's stuff like that please please take not of this this is a clear hack you should use it so this is uh how we would FASTT track somebody of the recruitment chain and our recruiters are always looking for you know this extra special spark we've been fortunate because we've got you know I mean the fact that you know you chose us I'm thankful that you chose us to collaborate with uh you know I remember we spoke very briefly I think briefly and you know there's something in your mind you said look we got to do a course with this I was also like I don't know if we can really do it we went and built a team so we put uh you know the people building this course are two of our top talents there's radika and there's anul uh radika has basically been with shebang for about you know six years out of the eight years that that we've been around she's a she was our head of strategic planning okay so she's been moved to specifically look at Academy and you know one of the big projects in the academy is the partnership that we have with you guys and anel also started his career at Shang uh did about 3 years went to be an entrepreneur came back and he leads our culture and communication so they're both like very closely working on this together I think they've built something very interesting so you know I honestly feel that um and I'm not talking about Master's Union but most MBA colleges or BBA colleges I think the way they teach marketing the four Ps and this and that I mean are those things those things even relevant today like is that's what's going to get them through the interview no no that's not that's not going to get them through the interview I think those four Ps Etc are still important because it's like a mental model in which the world thinks so you have to kind of know a mental model in which the world thinks but today's people who are breaking the mod are the ones who are breaking the models so if you can show a bit of that then that is what we are looking for got it and as not just we are looking for I think that is what all clients are looking for you know so this happy done smile one that I'm talking to you about which is that how do you have a mindset which connects the dots between saying that okay the purpose of this company is actually to make people smile and therefore I will make the ones who don't hear comedy smile and then I will build an AI which turns every video into a comedy video that is what then gets appreciated at the global scale uh so we are looking for Minds like that who can you know like see sense know but how do you like I mean clearly the usual curriculum of an MBA school is not going to prepare you to be able to build such campaigns yeah I mean let's accept that what will I think a lot of classroom learning um and a lot of like real exposure to the world and a lot of also uh you know like for me why I said share the load because share the load was the blueprint for me to come with salary calculator because I look at that work and I then I talk to the people who are behind that work I understand what's going on I spend some time with the marketing manager I spend some time with the architect of the campaign the creative architect of the campaign a guy called Josie Paul Legend in our industry okay uh you know so once you see a bit of that and you see what is going on behind the thinking you start forming the mental models and then that's what you break so I feel like that is if if in classes is you get to see a lot more of the world outside the class and if you get to expose yourself to the world outside the class and the thinking that goes on behind that you know so today for example I I know that you know with with respect to AI also one is can I use uh visual Ai and can I use video AI but actually in the top professional companies what kind of prompts are they putting that is delivering and at what point does the prompt stop and the design engineering actually come in where do I bring in the human where do I remove the AI you know those practical things of knowing seeing sensing will move somebody forward forward so like I mean what I'm what I'm hearing is that you need to First have exposure to all of these campaigns you should have at least seen 100 200 campaigns and automatically to come with the first one will become muscle memory to you yeah there's a fantastic website if people want to go to it's called love thework.com loveth work.com and it's got a free version also love theork more.com or something like that where you can see the campaigns that have won at the International Festival of creativity for the last what have you like you know 10 15 20 years so it's it's a it's a great platform for people to uh to go in and we've included some of that in the course that you know we've we've built out together uh so of course the course is called strategic marketing and AI why that why why AI I mean I know like our teams worked on it but yeah like I'd still love to hear from you yeah so why I mean there was a thought to it uh you know and there was a bit of the old and a bit of the new that's what we tried to put into the course so strategic marketing and AI because AI is the next big thing that people will need to get good at prompt engineering is what"

            "content": "people will need to get good at you know getting prompts to do design and at scale is what people need to get good at using AI to do analysis at a large level is what people need to get good at you know today you put an Excel sheet into gp4 it will give you an analysis of how it is now how can I further improve that how can I further build dashboards which are like you know enabled with GPD 4 but also giving me directional signals so AI from a Content creation perspective from a technology uh utilization perspective to analyze from a you know design perspect perspective to get the most beautiful outputs from the perspective of also you know I mean just using those apis to build new products like you product idea we're not doing it right now but we had this uh thing with Maybelline New York which they have a big initiative around mental health and what they found is that there is uh one therapist for every 100,000 people in India okay so the best way to do it is to turn everybody into mental health allies you know that's the way people can be there for each other so the product idea that we to them is that you know an app which is just listening while you're being an ally is listening to you is recognize your voice is listening to you and then giving you guidance on how you can do better what are the followup questions you can ask what can you exactly so like that kind of stuff is you know if you want to build that kind of stuff AI is that and then strategic marketing because we do a lot of like Basics I think while we're talking about the new it's very important to remember the old uh so you know what is brand Persona what is branding branding Basics but really the coolest brands in the world and breaking that down is what we're doing so it's a bit of old and new uh and also how to speak to Consumers you know fundamentally while we do all this new stuff the biggest strength in marketing and the biggest the strongest marketing people are the ones who understand consumers really well and the ones who don't have the fear of talking to Consumers absolutely um and who don't have the fear of judgment on consumers you know one of the biggest lessons I learned with a mistake I was making I was handling marketing for a cruise company I made a statement I walked into the room I made a statement one of my mentors was in the room and I said to her that you know these are people who are who would go to Mahindra holidays kind of people so they're not like that uh premium so I think we should Market this way she says stop right there because what you've just done is you made a judgment on that consumer you know you've bucketed them in a certain way every consumer you go under the skin you will find that there are a lot more more nuances more nuances to it and your job is to appreciate those nuances and then find the thing that will really appeal to them to sell that cruise so that was a big lesson for me so we try to bring a bit of the old and the new together got it this is very interesting I mean so I mean let's go back to from newspapers to TV to digital to influencer to Now Products and experiences that add value and then to prepare for that our students or just future marketers just have to be really good at AI so they can know the power of AI they can leverage that to build these I mean products are not going to be easy it's not going to be as easy as crafting copy for newspaper ad right that's where the a will come in it help you sort of you know the no tools Etc yeah um so I mean uh you know and we we've worked together on Crafting this this this course and we're very thankful for your time in your team's time what I want to understand is you know like we believe in learning by doing right and not learning by listening yeah yeah um and so all of these things that we talking about will the students actually get to create campaigns and Pitch campaigns to real customers or yourself as they go through the course then everybody gets a virtual internship okay so that's what does that mean what does that that means that they'll be inducted into a pod into the company where they will be working on live Brands and they will have the opportunity to pitch ideas they will have the opportunity to go and meet consumers they will have the opportunity to like really understand the briefs that some of the largest companies are working on so the learning by doing is going to happen uh a lot of the learning by doing is also going to happen in the course workor so you know part of the coursework is to build a new brand part of the coursework is to you know really do something a project AI so you know any of these pieces also going to be there and then there's going to be the virtual internship and 20 people get to do the internship physically on the on on in your offices in in the offices so uh you know I think there's going to be a lot that people can take out of it and they learning by doing the philosophy that Master's Union has is going to stay true I think I mean we are very clear that through this partnership we have to be able to add value to what the philosophy you guys have and simultaneously for us also the philosophy that we have of taking the best Indian Talent across the world we should be able to you know see good experiments coming out of that you know I want to I want to touch on placements a little bit right so of course 20 kids will end up working with you as interns and of course some of them and I hope all of them actually convert to a full-time role but once they've gone through this course do think other agencies would be open to taking these kids or will they feel no they you know they came from a competitor um I hope not I hope not uh it's going to be a good experiment to see honestly and uh we I mean I would love to take people who have worked in my competition I mean I learned from them exactly I don't know how the agencies think no may maybe everybody needs to think like you but uh but but I I hope so I I don't see it as a bit of you know that big a problem because I think what people are going to see is what cour workk they've done and you know how they've really what they've done on their internship projects and um you know also we've been I mean not specifically for this but I've been speaking to the uh advertising agencies Association about how we need to be more involved in training and all for you know then therefore adding their stamp to it also so maybe one of the things we could do is have one of the associations also put the stamp let's work on that actually it's a great idea so you know so that it doesn't become just shebang and it's also like it's it's actually what we've done from our end is it's shebang Academy who's doing it not not shabang itself not shabang itself and shebang academy uh so far we've trained over 1500 people across you know multiple periods of time right uh so and that's something that we are solidifying further as well so I think it's is shabang is more shabang Academy it's uh as you said also people who are getting a peak into working on the largest Brands and they'll be ready to be hired by uh you know by by our competitors for all me you know by all means let them you know if you look at the placement reports across Business Schools undergrad and postgrad uh there is understanding it might be wrong and you have to break this myth if it's a myth that marketing salaries are always lower than product management salaries that marketing salaries are always lower than data science salaries that marketing salaries are lower than the sales plus the commission that you own as sales so is that true and if it is I mean and also how do the salaries evolve over time yeah so it is true an entry-level marketing salary at entry level entry level so I think it's important to classify at entry level uh two things marketing has a lot more jobs so number one the number of jobs available in marketing a lot more second is the entry level salary is always lower but to be a good marketeer you will rise up the ranks very very fast I have had uh people who joined me at an entry level salary of 4 lakh in 8 years earning 45 black W so the speed of growth that you can look 10 times in 8 years yeah 10 times in 8 years is the speed of growth that you can look at uh I think also because marketing I mean it's not a very like it's not a very routine regimental job you know you need to bring your skill you need to bring your creativity you need to be able to bring an understanding of the market so the ones who are actually very good they get a fairly good premium as time goes by um and I think also in today's world today's marketeers are much better equipped to be tomorrow's CEOs than today's Finance professionals or data professionals because what happens with data is that you're not really yes you're seeing a lot of data but you're not interacting with the world and you're not interacting with the customer you're not being close to the customer you're not doing something that actually drives Topline growth you may drive efficiencies through data but with marketing you have the skill to be able to drive offline growth growth will come through yeah you also interact with a lot more people you know all sorts of customers entire company a good marketing campaign in a large company will always bring along the entire company so you know you're getting CEO skills by starting as a marketeer got it uh I think the other role that would really you know that that are ready for CEO is the sales people yeah because if you can again anything that you can do to drive Topline growth uh a company wants the CEO who does that with an interaction with maximum people so still I would say marketing and sales are the drivers on that not data not data is I mean I'm not saying data is not good but I don't think a data person they they lose out on a lot of that so it's a function of what you leave on the table unless unless a data person uses data to you know help the marketing team and and build a market better I mean that also but but I I would argue against that you know why why I would say that is because ultimately you're looking at data in know silos in Excel sitting alone sitting yeah I mean you'll interact with a few people but you won't interact as much you won't move things today still companies are pro companies looking for professionals who can make things Bloom and the people who can make things blooms are the bloom are the ones who can move mountains and the ones who can move mountains I believe are the marketeers no I I'll share one campaign that's really worked for us"

            "content": "yeah there was a campaign for blue Skittles okay so what they did was a very very interesting campaign where uh so Skittles actually removed the blue Skittles from their packs and uh it's not consumers tied to notice and then consumers are like where are the blue Skittles so then they released a video of this uh truck driver in Romania uh who said I I have a truck full of only blue Skittles in my truck but I'm not going to move anywhere till you guys join me on the journey so it was co-creation campaign with consumers where they had to basically gamify through likes through comments through different different activities as it went along to move the truck and finally the truck reached the packaging plant where then blue Skittles were reinstated back into uh you know things like that so so that's a that's an interesting campaign that that I can remember of blue Skittles I I remember one um which was Kinder Joys campaign I don't know if you they they created this app I don't know if it was on in the in India but a lot of kids in the US were using it so you can basically like earn Kinder Joys by being on the app and playing a certain game and there were a bunch of games like you know from from Snake and Ladders to to chess Etc and you can gain points and then actually redeem it for like Kinder Joys nice and they connected the gamification with the joy of obtaining a Kinder Joy it's also quite interesting too yeah we working on the Kinder Joy uh uh the new launch for the I mean there's this post Diwali Etc all of that we have some interesting work coming out for Kinder Joy have you also uh so the company I used to run before Master's Union was a company called outgrow and uh we make interactive content tools for marketing campaigns right uh and it's a Dr drag and drop system where um you know you can just create quizzes assessments graders and one of our most popular quizzes um which was on BuzzFeed for almost 11 years was which Disney Princess am I uh yes do you remember that yeah yeah yeah it's like 20 220 million click clicks wow annually wow right and like why does everyone care about the Disney princess but it's super interesting and what they would do with that you know is that they will ask some very interesting questions uh like you know what's your shoe size right and once they have shoe sizes of 220 million people a year imagine what cool stuff you can do with that absolutely right so they actually to sell that data to shoe companies yeah and say Hey listen now you can actually Target yeah so there are uh you know like uh so like syndicates which classify a lot of this data put a third party layer to it and then resell it further to company so we would for example buy like you could buy uh post paid users you could buy credit card bill the cookies for them oh yeah of 2 lakh rupees or 3 lakh rupees a month plus so that kind of make sure that your targeting is a bit more personalized so that's where this whole you know that's where our media team actually comes in which is that our media buying and syndication team uh which kind of decides big money decisions for clients so there's the creative guys who decide okay what to say then there's the media guys who say where to say and then there's the technology layer of people who kind of say that you know for all of this that what to say where to say we're putting the infrastructure layer also for clients uh and that's where personalization comes in one of the really top end cases that we've done is for Tata Communications where we built a Netflix like consumer experience for a B2B brand now in B2B you don't typically see the Netflix iation you know what I mean by the Netflix iation is that what I want to see I see at that very moment so uh right with respect to IP tracking what we've done is uh basically built an IP tracking and some technology on top of that uh third party technology on top of that to identify where the consumer is coming from uh if we have first party data of that consumer which means we know that the consumer is already a company that is registered in interest with you know the client uh then the website personalizes very differently versus if they're coming from North America versus Europe it personalizes very differently and some cases because of the IP tracking you also get to understand the industry they're coming from so if they're coming from Auto then you see only white papers with respect to cloud and auto so that kind of makes it you know so this link what you're saying that I mean I'm just trying to link the two dots one is can I know the shoe size can I know what they've bought from me before and can I know where they're coming from so I know what sells in those regions so I then show only that you know that's where that's what's exciting about marketing right now yeah I mean it's it's it's way more than just copyrighting and it's way more than just crafting an ad I think there's so much more intelligence that goes into building a successful campaign yeah and you see a little bit of your like you know data is coming here your analysis of data is coming here but if you can orchestrate this whole thing together that's why I say that a good marketer today is ready to be a CEO CEO yeah they touch they touch every Department every skill essentially got it um"
