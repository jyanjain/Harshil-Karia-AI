I am one and I’ve sat in boardrooms where I’ve heard a variety of sweeping generalizations which I haven’t ever agreed with! So, I jumped at this opportunity to give my (or rather our) side of the story. Roughly 60% of this country is below 30. You can’t put a finger on reading this new breed of Indian. In terms of mindset, there is no right or wrong. You could be child-married, lesbian or someone who doesn’t believe in marriage. You could be politically charged, indifferent or even anti politics. Never has there been a group of people in this country so diametrically diverse, open to different ideas and closed to ‘rules’.This is also by far the most wasteful generation India has seen. I remember sitting in a meeting with a major alcohol manufacturer, gloating about a spike in vodka consumption in middle India, post-2008. The curve was scary and suddenly vertical; the sort that marketers love. But it tells you something about the mindset of millennials. Consumption of alcohol is one story. Another is revealed when you walk around key landmarks and can smell all sorts of substances in the air. Weed being circulated as early as grade 11 is not unheard of. Not only Punjab, in my reading every major Indian city is Udta. Here’s a generation that wants to do a lot and forget. We’re highly schizophrenic. And I think that’s one of the reasons why there is so much diversity in thinking. This also allows millennials to jump between the different people he or she can be. It isn’t uncommon to see a millennial have a completely different outlook within a span of 2-3 years. With access to so much information, with days dragging on and nights getting harder, it is a generation that treats time differently. I think one of the biggest myths is that they’re nationalistic, politically motivated and charged. Perhaps this is because of the halo of people like  or the disproportionate media coverage given to cases like Jessica Lal’s, where a large number of youth took to the streets or Anna Hazare’s movement against corruption. In India, young people have always taken to the streets. Be it pre-independence, in the 70s or even the 90s. So the idea of Indian Youth being politically motivated isn’t new. What is new however, is that this young India now has the world at its fingertips, wants to have a worldview and wants to have their opinion known. Case in point: the number of young Indians from the likes of AIB to an average Joe in Kanpur who put up long sermons about how Trump coming to power is the End of The World.  playing on sentiments of nationalism would do well if they enable Indian youth to engage in the lip service they pay their country. Or provide them with a new way to be seen or think how the nation is governed. The same applies to entrepreneurship. The Bansals have probably given this halo of millennials being entrepreneurially inclined. However, according to a recent EY survey, 44% prefer staying with one company through their career. Only 22% want to start up. The number who eventually do is smaller. What’s also interesting about millennials and Gen Z  is that ‘new’ or ‘novel’ or ‘noteworthy’ doesn’t remain that for too long. As soon as a first batch have shared something and achieved glory, it loses its appeal. Lest the others seem “Me Too”. That brings me to the next myth. Brands believe millennials want to connect in “communities”. Sunsilk Gang of Girls, Jaago Re, WeLoveMakeUp are all examples that prove otherwise. Millennials, according to me, are quite fickle. They want to plug and play in and out of ecosystems as opposed to getting entrenched in them. Each millennial is his or her own advertisement and his or her own community. Everyone wants to post, sing, dance, and build followings around themselves. They don’t want to belong, or be tied down into something and get defined by it. It comes back to the point that a millennial could be a totally different person every two years. They’re about re-invention as opposed to definition. Brands that can aid re-invention and either be at the cutting edge of culture or be so utilitarian in terms of consistency and price that they become almost second nature, are likely to thrive. The final myth: digital is the ‘Holy Grail’. To “own” millennials, marketers will need to understand how they link with each other, with brands, with influencers, with media platforms and devices. India’s millennials haven’t yet shifted their entertainment preferences online. Less than 2% of 18-34-years old changed the channel during commercials, compared with 5.5% of 35-54-years old and more than 8% of viewers 55 and older. Given their engagement with other devices, however, millennials had the lowest program engagement and lowest ad memorability scores. So, they’re not paying attention. Hence the thought maybe let’s catch them on digital. There one sees stats like Facebook ads drive 5% incremental reach for SEC AB as compared to TV - however the truth is the average amount a user spends on a video on Facebook is 1.3 seconds. In such a short span how much can be communicated? This is not to say that digital doesn’t work but it certainly isn’t a ‘deploy and win’ medium where one size fits all. It’s an interesting, differentiated and diversified generation, one that doesn’t pay attention and would rather build its own brand or community, assimilating other brands and communities. One that’s happy moonlighting among various personality types, ecosystems and brands. And one that won’t accept being put into a homogenous bucket."
