            "content": "I mean like I could I could talk about that a bit more but yeah it comes back to rupees so like you know for me what happened is in uh somewhere around 2018 uh so I started the shebang Journey not 2018 it was 2017 2018 in the middle of that um it was about 2015 when I started the schbang journey two years into the journey I was just about trying to survive so you know you can talk about big things like purpose but I think before purpose comes survival so you have to uh so I decided I wanted to do this Enterprise I had left back the earlier Enterprise I'm doing a second one and really the first two years were just about going through you know like rights and crafts and you know you can um put on an Excel sheet that you will lose this much money but when it's your own money that you're losing and you're bleeding that money to really go through that is a challenging task in itself so you know I've been through now those I've been through 2015 to 2017 and survived um and then at the time I was uh trying to you know I was sitting and most of us have these moments where we discover that purpose so for me the discovery of that purpose was it was in a two-day workshop you know I mean classical uh scenario where you basically take a pause and you start to really know yourself and which is why I come back to saying that you know your purpose is linked to really knowing yourself so I sat down and two days we had to switch off it was a group of about 15 to 20 of us from the team uh working with my coach saloni Suri so this is the first time I'm doing a workshop with her and uh the first day was really me just shutting down and going through the self-assessment exercises so I knew that you know this was now coming to me that okay your people pleasing orientation is high your your ability to do conflict is a bit low you know your Clarity is good so then you start seeing that you start seeing okay this is who I really am and then there was a bunch of other things which we did in that and the second day we had to do an exercise in what was the golden hour early in the morning you know do a bit of reflection and that's when in that golden hour it came to me that look you know I've survived these two years of building this company and I am going to turn this company into a global company born out of India in the marketing and Technology Services business because there is no other company in that domain really which has established itself so that's when I coined to my team on that second afternoon I said we will go from India to the world and bring the best of the world to India so that really gave me a sense of anchoring and purpose so then when covert came uh and when you know we we all had to go through those difficult times letting you know considering to let go of people and trying to figure out what you where things are really going exactly exactly so that anchor of saying that that's how long the game you want to play and therefore the speed bump that you've seen right now which was a pretty big speed bump back then is a small blip as compared to the longer game so that is where I feel purpose really you know kind of comes into the picture you also make an interesting point it is that oftentimes you tend to believe that you need to figure out your purpose very early on before you start but sometimes once you start on a certain journey and you have at least a few elements in play yeah um I feel you realize your purpose or better like I honestly didn't know my own purpose till I would say a couple of years ago when I did a similar exercise I worked with my coach and and she and I sat down because I was literally saying okay been through this journey grew glitch we sold I was considering exiting but I'm like I don't know what I'm supposed to do what is my purpose and I never really sat and done that I used to I wasn't a Believer I would just think you you do what you have to do but there's a certain emptiness and and I think doing that for me in some ways I feel it shows you things which you already know yeah but you maybe don't want to face because you feel it's you know you use the word um you know you said people pleasing and and you you again and not really conflict um not really Pro conflict in that sense I feel that also adds to it because you don't want to pick out things that you believe might change what seems to already be working yeah yeah did you feel that did you feel that slight amount of like pushback from yourself I felt slightly different so what I felt is that once you start discovering your purpose there's a reverberation that starts coming inside you to push you towards that so I think the moment it came down on paper that you know these are the couple of weaknesses that you have not really weaknesses I wouldn't call them weaknesses but these are this is where you are right now and versus where you want to go this is what you're going to have to work on to take that leap so the Insight starts reverberating and saying that look you know let's start working on it and I'm pretty sure it's similar with you as well it's also the shadow you realize what your Shadow side is you understand what you're trying to evade being by you know yeah by trying to avoid conflict or by trying to because I relate to those two especially because that's something which I struggled with for a long time you also went pushing away from what you don't want to become yeah and then you start then you you know then the whole work of integrating with the shadow side versus just hating on it is a different work altogether but you know first that reverberation comes and uh you know once that starts coming in you you start like really you almost have an internal booster in yourself to maximize yourself to you know I kept seeing that this is who I am this is who I need to grow into and then further this this is who I need to grow into so you start channeling yourself for growth and I think that's a really fun part because again when you see purpose and you see who you need to grow into that's the motivation for you to wake up every day and say okay let's do this you know"

            "content": "the first set of sessions you know that first two days I requested saloni saying you know let's fly down to Bangalore and uh let's let's do this with the team in Bangalore and we had finished day one again it seems like this day one has a theme if it finished day one and I was sitting down with her for dinner I had the opportunity I wasn't working with her one-on-one yet then but I had the opportunity to sit with her one-on-one and because there was this reverberation happening inside me I kind of put it to her saying that there's something I'm really struggling with um and thing I was struggling with at the time was that it was about it was a good period of time where I was trying to get rid of a habit of uh smoking hash every night before going to sleep and I usually try to take the opportunity to you know whenever I get the opportunity in a platform like this if there's a lot of young people speaking to speak about it because because I was trying to get out of it for two years and I was trying to get out for two years and I would wake up every morning my first search would be how to stop smoking hash and there would be some research papers on what it's doing to your mind and things like that but you know that's the thing with an addiction is the next morning you're back at it so I opened up to her saying that you know I didn't really had the courage to say it to anybody that it's a problem um and I opened up to her saying that this is the problem that I'm facing I'm not able to get out of it and that night she said to me one important thing she said that you know you're constantly getting high because you're not high on your own life and it may be different sentences for different people but that sentence is really hit home with me uh so it kind of permeated into my subconscious and that night is when she gave me a meditation to try for the first time so I feel like it had something to do with really permeating that message really deep into my subconscious because that was the last night I picked up a joint so I didn't touch it after that night I'm in cold turkey it's been five and a half years I haven't touched it and I think that's a big you know it's it kind of connected a little bit of this reverberation of the inside meets the messaging from the outside and that's when I knew also that in this space of meditation I want to do something um and then you know different signals came as I went along that you know this is a space that I should be getting into but but yeah I mean as we go along the journey these things start happening to us I'm glad you shared that right because you know you oftentimes give in to like for me that was smoking like a map smoked I think clearly started which I would um smoke an easy like 10 plus cigarettes a day for a good period of time if not longer you're on a show too you know I would tend to do that and I quit cold turkey because I realized that I was just like I was like 27 and I was panting for breath when I was on on a shoot or something like that and at some point I had to stop and it's best I found an opportunity whether a time to stop because robots was my co-founder didn't smoke and only two of us started together so best time to evade it um but I think back on that decision and I think back on even sometime recently when I started like look at Food differently change my relationship with sleep and mindfulness is that there are movements and you those choices come to you and I feel like like say use a reverberation I feel they are it's not just a singular choice it's the environment you set yourself in it's what you almost fed your mind because you know you went through that day one and your mind was primed for you to get into this exactly um rather than you just focusing on what you need to change you are you're almost curious about okay I want to see how this skin kind of not be a thing um and I feel that and I've been learning that Curiosity plays a strong part in in getting out of these um habit Loops as you call them yeah yeah and I think that that's one thing to kind of latch on to yeah yeah for sure I mean it's uh you use the word curiosity I I think also some way the pause is also very very important just you know just to give that space to let that and that's why I resonate with this idea of Reverb Prince you know so within that pause the river Prince comes because you give that pause and then you suddenly have a lot of okay you know let this reverberate and let it come to the top it's interesting that we're having this um recording today my last night's meditation and I do guided meditation before I go to sleep um spoke about horizontal thinking versus vertical thinking and it says that we're always on a horizontal plane in letter you're figuring out okay what am I doing next how are we moving ahead and all that stuff and only when you pause do you think vertically yeah and you kind of look at it from a slightly longer sense and I know we're using different terms what he's saying this the same thing is is that we got to take that moment to really make that choice but also give yourself the opportunity to do it ever since then have you seen yourself almost like tap into that almost like as a mechanism when you want to make a choice yeah 100 um so I think I mean I've done two things I've kind of programmed that horizontal vertical into my everyday uh because uh so the first thing I wake up in the morning is I'm really really just trying to focus on maximizing that time to wake up in the morning because I'm I've realized that for me I'm a very very strong morning person uh that's my time to really invest in myself focus in myself so the first thing I wake up is uh I try and sit and buy you an early riser earlier no I mean I've always been an early riser but not very you know like not at the extreme of the morning now I just you know like when everything is shut down when when the world is silent that's the hour now I tend to enjoy the most uh and I've always been an early riser but you know I mean I I wasn't really looking at again with intention so you know again I was like late night wake up just either rush to class in college or like run to the office at like whatever I was saying that one is to you know coming back to what you're saying which is the horizontal and the vertical kind of programming it into creating more opportunities for that so programming is basically being able to create more opportunities for that so in that morning"

Harshil Karia On His Minimalistic Lifestyle to that something in me just said remove all the attachments so that you know then it started then it started saying that you know clothes is the first thing I think loads actually already happened before that because you know when I left when I left foxy so you have a big fat salary and uh I think at that time when I left I was I would say at my egoistic highest to when I started shebang uh so roughly you are earning five six like a month at the time to go down to 20 000 bucks at the time so automatically you know you have to change your lifestyle so that was like one uh accelerator but when we said let go of attachments then you know let go of dependencies of other people on your life so I said okay I'm not going to have somebody drive me I don't like driving so I will bike everywhere it's faster it's parking it's yeah it's it's easier to park it's faster it's an appear than aside saying that okay you know if I have to bike everywhere that means I have to sweat less if I have to sweat less I have to really watch what I eat so I have to make sure that my food has got you know the exact composition which makes me not sweat so that's what I started doing with that I said okay if I'm you know I've got the same uh it's a friend of mine Mohan Vilas he says uh he's a monk actually very interesting story of a guy who was peak of his material career and then decided to become a monk but he said one thing which stayed with me is like all I need is my four pairs of clothes to to be able to survive so I said let me try to do that so when I travel can I pack my whole two weeks three weeks into a small cabin luggage so if I have to do that then my my closet is going to get less you know less filled in that sense and uh I mean I still I still enjoy the things that make the world amazing I still love that you know I get I I Marvel at a great painting or I will look at a you know I look at your space and say it's it's amazing but the desire to own a space like this is significantly lesser the the desire to enjoy the space in this moment for what it is you know and then maybe request you after this that you know Varun can I just sometimes come and hang out with you here and see this space with you and enjoy the space with you sometimes is is there but it's a transient life and within that transient life how can I enjoy the most of these experiences is is how I'm trying to structure my life at this point in time and I hope it I mean I hope it accelerates in this journey because you know again the thing with life is that you you set yourself out on one thing and then you know there is another Fork down the road but but I enjoy I'm enjoying where I'm at right now I might think at uh good uh if I had to pause it's a good place"
