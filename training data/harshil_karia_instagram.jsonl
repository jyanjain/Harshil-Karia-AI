      "content": "I'm writing this for my friend Ranveer Allahbadia...\n\nLife is challenging and it can test you. Ranveer has learnt that recently. One controversy, and years of value someone brought and hard work someone put in, can wither away. I’ve also been advised not to be associated with him by lots of people I respect. That's how hard some of this can be. But a friendship is a friendship. And the lens through which I’ve seen him remains deeply valued and respected.\n\nRanveer has long been admired by the masses of India. People inherently love him for who he is. And along with the love he manages to generate, I admire his discipline, consistency, and how deeply he cares about what he puts out into the world.\n\nI want to share about three pieces of content I loved that helped me appreciate him better and learn from his work.\n\nFirst is his latest documentary on hair. A powerful mix of vulnerability and research. One of the best pieces I’ve seen on the subject. It’s classic Ranveer in a new avatar that people have loved, and people have always loved him for adding value to their lives. He does it in a great way here.\n\nSecond is his ‘Taakat’ episode with Suresh Raina. It reinvented the podcast format. Not the same static setup. It felt like you were in the room with them. It shows how well he understands film and camera.\n\nThird is his piece on the platinum button. The way it was shot and delivered was exceptional. The kind of content that reminds you why you started.\n\nPeople have said rude things. Doubted him. Scrutinized his every word.\nThrough all the noise, he’s kept creating. Kept showing up.\n\nHe’s doing some of the best work I’ve seen. I respect him for that. And I love him like a brother. \n\nKudos to @ranveerallahbadia, the team, and the co-founder of beerbiceps @join2manish and @nachiket.nisal the man managing the Rocket."

The teachers aren’t outsiders—they’re from their own villages. People they trust, guiding them towards a future they never thought possible.\n\nVidyavaan is more than just education. It’s a revolution of hope.\n\nIt’s about breaking barriers, building futures, and rewriting destinies.\n\nBut there’s still a long way to go.\nMany children still drop out. Many still don’t see the power of learning.\nAnd that’s where YOU come in.\n\n- If this inspires you, share it. Let’s make education a priority for every child.\n- Tag someone who believes in this cause.\n- Want to help? Join us in making a difference.\n\nBecause when a child learns, a future brightens. And that’s a future worth fighting for. 💙\n\n@harshiljkaria @govardhanruraldevelopment @schbang \n\n#Vidyavaan #EducationForAll #TribalEducation #BreakingTheCycle #TeachToTransform #LearnToRise #GreaterGoodFoundation #ImpactThatMatters #ChangingLives #FutureBeginsHere #ngoindia"

There’s so many people who’ve really found themselves at Schbang - something inside the walls that has the ability to lift people up, shine out parts of themselves and infuse their most excited selves into creating magic. I’m grateful for the energy and excitement we get to feel every single day. \n\nSpecial thanks to the Schbang Leadership for facilitating this transition so well and using this period to inspire increased client confidence and build stronger teams. (For context - https://www.storyboard18.com/brand-makers/schbang-consolidates-its-holding-structure-as-harshil-karia-and-sohil-karia-secure-complete-ownership-58128.htm). I’m proud of how you’ve come together and looking forward to the closer ties we forge. \n\nA heartfelt thank you to all the mentors, partners and well wishers of Schbang who have supported this journey. \n\nThere’s been a lot of work behind the scenes at Schbang. Some of it you must already be seeing with the fantastic work we’ve been putting out but there’s more cooking and we can’t wait to show you everything! \n\nDecade 1 done! Many more to go."

Because when parents and teachers work together, students thrive! \n\nKey insights from our session:\n\n✅ Understanding different types of parents & their expectations 🤝 \n\n✅ Setting study plans with parents rather than focusing on shortcomings.\n\n✅ Going the extra mile with community visits and one-on-one meetings to understand each child’s background. \n\n✅ Communicating difficult messages with empathy & active listening.\n\n✅ Managing conflicts constructively for an stress-free learning environment. \n\n✅ Engaging parents as active participants in their child’s education.\n\nImagine a world where every parent-teacher meeting is a collaboration, not a confrontation. \n\nWe’re working to make this a reality! \n\nJoin us in driving this change!\n\nPartner with the Greater Good Foundation to support teachers, schools, and communities in building a brighter future.\n\n📩 Let’s talk – DM us or comment below to collaborate! \n\n#TeachWise #EducationForAll #ParentTeacherCollaboration #GreaterGoodFoundation #ImpactEducation"

For many of these students, this is their first step toward rediscovering their potential—breaking barriers, embracing technology, and envisioning a brighter future.\n\nIn just two sessions—Content Creation and Artificial Intelligence—students have:\n\n- Created their first-ever reels and launched their own Instagram pages,\n- Begun identifying their niches and building their personal narratives,\n- Explored tools like HeyGen to craft dynamic content,\n- And developed their first websites using AI, unlocking new possibilities.\n\nMany of these students are school dropouts. For the girls, societal norms and parental restrictions have often kept them from pursuing education further. For the boys, financial struggles have pushed them to prioritize earning over learning, believing it to be the only way to support their families. Despite these challenges, their determination to grow and learn has been truly inspiring.\n\nThis program is more than skill-building; it is about empowering individuals to rewrite their stories and break free from the challenges holding them back.

He spoke about how challenges come and go, and how meditation helps us stay steady through it all. That moment didn’t just surprise me—it inspired me. It showed how far we’ve come as a generation, moving from “drugs and rock & roll” to mindfulness and balance.\n\nDiljit, you’re a force. Your ability to stay present, real, and full of life is why so many of us admire you. On behalf of Ranveer, Aayush, and myself, thank you for using your platform to create such a positive impact.\n\nI’m taking this opportunity to thank @sonalisingh and her team at @rippleeffectstudios for everything you do to amplify Diljit’s vision and presence. At @levelsupermind, we’re on a similar mission—to make meditation and wellness more accessible to today’s youth. If there’s ever a way we can align and work together, it would be an honor. \n\nWishing you the happiest birthday, Diljit, filled with love, light, and even more inspiration for all of us. Keep shining—you’re truly one of a kind."

Your reflections are invaluable as I continue on this journey.\n\nFeeling incredibly grateful for this moment and looking forward to the next opportunity to share this practice with all of you. 🙏\n\n#Gratitude #MeditationJourney #ConsciousCollective #GuidedMeditation #MindfulnessInTheCity"

Of spiritual concerts. \nSomething special is about to take over. \n\nSpecial thanks to @databyharsh for handling all the logistics. Pulling an event off single handedly is no easy task - and this young man did it well. Despite the challenges - we did well 😊\n\nThis warm conversation with Radhika post the concert is something I'll never forget. I learnt valuable lessons in kindness and warmth. \n\nGlad life has so my lessons to serve. \n\n~Radhe Govinda"
