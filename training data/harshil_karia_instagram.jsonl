One controversy, and years of value someone brought and hard work someone put in, can wither away. I‚Äôve also been advised not to be associated with him by lots of people I respect. That's how hard some of this can be. But a friendship is a friendship. And the lens through which I‚Äôve seen him remains deeply valued and respected.\n\nRanveer has long been admired by the masses of India. People inherently love him for who he is. And along with the love he manages to generate, I admire his discipline, consistency, and how deeply he cares about what he puts out into the world.\n\nI want to share about three pieces of content I loved that helped me appreciate him better and learn from his work.\n\nFirst is his latest documentary on hair. A powerful mix of vulnerability and research. One of the best pieces I‚Äôve seen on the subject. It‚Äôs classic Ranveer in a new avatar that people have loved, and people have always loved him for adding value to their lives. He does it in a great way here.\n\nSecond is his ‚ÄòTaakat‚Äô episode with Suresh Raina. It reinvented the podcast format. Not the same static setup. It felt like you were in the room with them. It shows how well he understands film and camera.\n\nThird is his piece on the platinum button. The way it was shot and delivered was exceptional. The kind of content that reminds you why you started.\n\nPeople have said rude things. Doubted him. Scrutinized his every word.\nThrough all the noise, he‚Äôs kept creating. Kept showing up.\n\nHe‚Äôs doing some of the best work I‚Äôve seen. I respect him for that. And I love him like a brother. \n\nKudos to @ranveerallahbadia, the team, and the co-founder of beerbiceps @join2manish and @nachiket.nisal the man managing the Rocket."

This is the Supermind Hackathon by @levelsupermind partnered by @langflow_ai & @amazonwebservices with technology partnership from @findcoder_official and supported by @schbang \n\nIt's a dream to see so many coders across all the offices of Schbang occupying every seat and every inch of every desk to hack the night away. Best was to use 40,000 sq ft of unoccupied space on a weekend. \n\nThe man behind this is @kush_inthewild - kudos for orchestrating. @aayushmisfiit for seeing and backing the vision. @databyharsh holds everything I do like a rock (happy birthday) @vaibhavkamble166 - for all the arrangement and so many members of @teamlevelsupermind for giving their absolute best of this one ..\n\nSpecial special thanks to @sakshamchoudharyofficial\n& @hiteshchoudharyofficial for their amazing partnership in this endeavour.... \n\n3 task options Option 1) Build an automated research and trigger finder for YouTube | Option 2) Build a Smart Ai Transcription and Translation Model | Option 3) Build an Ai Powered Spiritual Guide \n\nThis great for our ecosystem to hire coders and we've promised this crew a target of atleast 100 coding jobs across our ecosystem. Time to build on."

On behalf of Ranveer, Aayush, and myself, thank you for using your platform to create such a positive impact.\n\nI‚Äôm taking this opportunity to thank @sonalisingh and her team at @rippleeffectstudios for everything you do to amplify Diljit‚Äôs vision and presence.
