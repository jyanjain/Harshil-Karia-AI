            "content": "i think the word everybody's talking about I would have started an AI first agency workflow modules which need to be bettered using AI and I would pitch that as a solution to brands uh because today also what we have to realize is I started in this market I think was our aunt May and those was our aunt May it was a fairly open market yes you had the biggies uh but Denu was not Den Su so for those of you listening who are not following advertising there are major holding groups there is uh WPP there is Denu there is Omnicom and IPG which is now merged together but it used to be Omnicom and IPG and there's Denu there's Hakuodo which is Japanese and there's Havas Havas six 78 however you slice it so uh you know there was all of these giants were there but market opening because none of them had specialized digital offering specialized social media offering specialized SEO offering entry but now the other thing which is more challenging in today's market is the market is moving so fast right so a skill gap which is spotted is getting covered so fast but I would still bet on AI or AI first agency when you say AI first everybody else is not already applying would you give AI service would you have AI service in your company you know in a way it's exciting because in a way because I'm trying to see marketap so uh for example one of the things that I see that gets lost in delivering the service is client agency number one number two is there's lot of institutional knowledge which is not getting captured so what do I mean by institutional knowledge company guideline number one number two company reject approve company numbers over the long period of time uh click uh through rates open rates uh view through rates uh engagement spikes minutes of the meeting uh open rates click rates basically the performance data across fullfunnel which is uh top of funnel influencer spends um emailer spends data uh brand guidelines consumer calls transcripts rejected posts approved posts rejected ads approved ads rejected scripts approved scripts okay I would assume already agency already has the documentation okay so basically if AI can be the second brain of the client agency relationship what AI can do is it can read creative context as well so one massive solution which I'm working on is that you can take all the ads run by a client ai can start tagging all those ads on 25 30 different parameters and you can then see which parameters are working to drive hook rate or clickthrough rate or view through rate so ads may be uh creative optimization you can use AI at scale to do that so uh that is the other thing and then of course uh to build out an AI brain which actually visually can design like the client's way of thinking okay is also solutions that are coming in place now with Firefly API etc um so those are solutions that I would build out uh so solutions which are allowing brands to be AI first to market in terms of quality of service in terms of uh agility of thinking and responsiveness to consumer and from the standpoint of you know this visual innovation but those are the areas that I would really go then recruitment recruit approve track which is able to screen applicants faster the other thing which we have built out as AI is um interview AI to candidate interview screening so some of these experiments maybe building these experiments for clients of using APIs to build out use cases inside the client is what I would really try to focus on okay so you would build these for yourself or would you build these for the clients and for the brands as a service to give to them both okay so as a self means I stand for it and to the client means I have that creativity of solutioning for you around it and one question that's coming into my mind is uh I hear a lot of Sam talk about uh open AI and he says that you should build something that uh open AI will not be able to build on top of it because otherwise it's like you said uh it's moving so fast that it will just then be able open AI will come up with that solution if you decode it what he's basically saying build a more niche use case because open AI will always build so a open AI will always be able to build what you're building uh but what he if If I decode that what he's basically saying is build something that is a hyper niche that has enough of a market uh which can add technical value but is not so lucrative also that open AI will cannibalize it that is you know one doubt that people have that if I today I'll create an AI but open AI service everything I do is gone to waste yeah but open AI is taking large bets right so what OpenAI wants us to do any of the AIS want us to do is use the API tokens to build on top of that so anything that you use as API tokens to build on top of that will work okay or rather anything that you use as OpenAI uh tokens API tokens to build on top of but is a niche use case and is not a mass market use case which everybody can use ai open is not necessarily going to take that bet understood uh"

            "content": "I think traditionally this industry has worked on a cost plus pricing model so the first thing you have to do is to serve that client Well depending on who that client is firstly you want to have a client which has a for whom marketing is important mhm uh and how do you evaluate marketing important isual business plan Auto brands trading business turnover category second is category typical marketing spends best branded players again if there is a marketing competition then the business will spend on trying to catch up because if you have if if your competition is a better brand you'll want to have equally a good brand okay so from what I understand from what you're saying is because benchmarking basis it's how you ask the question this is the category I'm in within this category who are the top five players and typically what kind of marketing spends are they doing if it's a publicly listed company then you will be able to get that through the quarterly transcripts or privately listed company register of companies balance sheets okay priyclisted companies is a new priority for them so then they'll say okay international business come I want to give you only but the moment you are able to preempt what the business needs then that's good now if it's a privately listed business you may want to study 10 balance sheets and today with AI you have the ability to study 10 balance sheets this fast so you put four balance sheets in you ask to analyze against each of the balance sheet to get a good sense of the business the more you know about the business the more valuable you become to your potential client turnover percent of marketing spendes which is marketallenge you know whatever internet cost overhead component so cost of uh running the manpower cost of the overhead and then the margin that is what you'll add as three components okay and How do you get an entry see that's now the market is so diversified that it's difficult for me to cut this question in a straightforward way because market now has like let me give you a context google is quoting that India is having 300,000 new advertisers every year on Google Adwords if Google is having 300,000 new advertisers on Google Adwords that means you have 300,000 new clients coming into the market now of course you that doesn't mean that all of them are spending lakhs and crores of rupees so first you be clear which segment of the market you want to play in the most crowded segment of the market is a segment I play in right now which is a segment for the large brands that has a maximum talent that also has a maximum spends by brands so that is why that is the largest segment i would say the segment which is the segment of the India growing brands would you say startups people who are startups or people who are large enterprises formalizing their businesses now and making it digital making it digital uh or even making it serious about marketing so like let me give you an example i love to travel to tier 2 cities to understand where is business going in this country so outside of Ahmedabad I met this company which is a oil company they have been making uh sunflower oil for many many years and now they are making uh coldressed extra virgin coconut oil okay so now that's a premiumization that they doing but purely without too much marketing so now to understand then he will be willing to do that so I'm saying like that there are many companies who have not built a brand but have grown a very large business it may not be a 2,000 cr business it may be 100 cr business 200 cr but these are still sizable businesses so how to walk and handhold with these entrepreneurs on the building of the brand journey is the other fun part for example 300,000 is that possible guarantee I see if you can guarantee that you would be running that business the idea is not to provide a guarantee because as the service provider what you're putting is your brains to say here is my reading of the situation if we follow this path we are likely to grow most of the time somebody who has made a 2,000 cr company he's a very smart person extremely smart person so that is what I think most of the clients are looking for okay and there are so many different cuts to be honest so there's a whole D2C wave so you can be a D2C specialist uh today I think one of the areas which is highly ignored is retention marketing so you can be a retention marketing specialist uh you can be SEO specialist you could be production production agency uh you could be a brand development agency so there are many cuts of marketing now and that is the joy of marketing as well as the complexity of marketing now and we are entering an age of uh surgical expertise so that is where I think the world is going i give the same advice so to people who are starting out now I would say for example something that you built where you're doing production also so I think it's important for them to pick one thing that they're going to be very good at expand for examp whether it's production whether it is um SEO whether it is whatever AI maybe or journey highlight and then they are known in that field which option I don't I think 10 years ago that was because that time brands wanted agency better correct correct yeah probably the brands being built out of India too are the brands you want to talk to okay if you want to do everything so let me be even more specific if you want because see where company wants somebody to do everything is when they themselves don't need a specialization okay because if I need generalized skills which is general brand building skill and I need a smart agency partner who will be able to handle everything those brands are today sitting in tier to India okay they are being built today so they are yesterday's Britannia today's Britannia wants a more structured service wants to work with the most highly skilled players but on the journey like you know if you look at Dr comptor so it's I guess based out of Punjab they are a local player and they want to become a national player so there they may need a local agency out there who's able to work with them but able to see the long picture with them h or like this oil company that I spoke about you know so there are so many of these companies which have locally very strong presence nabati is another one so Tamil Nadu based they make biscuits so when we are talking in the context of biscuit so I'm taking these examples but these all of these players will want agency partner that will see them through till a certain size so they will want a agency partner which has the ability to be a generalist across yeah and that can adjust and fluctuate according to them because I worked with a a client called Galaxy Rice which is huge in like they're selling in numbers Punjab May Rajasthan May and Delhi May and all of that and they're huge they sell a lot of rice um karnal company it is high level agency somebody who understands the core of India and understands how to market to them they wanted somebody like that correct and the and there's ripple in the south that I worked with they also are like that correct like we want to understand our market bombay agencies may not be able to kind of understand but then the market understanding second is they want flexibility flexibility and they they will say you're my trustworthy person i will build that now that allows you to be a generalist and that allows you to build multi-killed of what is yesterday today the example that you gave like my time when I started I could be a generalist but today if I enter a Bombay market then I have to be a specialist so what I'm doing in my setup is that I'm building multiple areas of specialization and I'm clear which areas of specialization I don't have okay what areas of specialization you don't work in I would say right now the one area within performance marketing for example uh like app downloads towards the area I don't work in okay because that's a very sharp niche that requires a particular kind of expertise in production uh there is a certain skill you need for self-p production of a two crore shoot beyond that so that area I don't work in okay so there are areas which I know but then I am upfront with my client about that these are the areas I don't work in the areas which I have consistently strengthened and there are only some certain signs that you can have which is that are you being well awarded in all the industry awards for that particular domain okay um you know are you winning consistent business is your referral score good is your net promoter score good on those services so that's how I track the health of the service okay like what I'm building right now for example which I'm still not very well known for as an example is a brand development service okay so if I mean I've built some good brands from scratch but it's not something I'm known for like a what a land would be known for right but now we've got an acquisition of addict which is now addict schbang which is based out of Holland so that they are the masters in branding so now we are integrating them into our offering to be able to say I can give you that really well seo as a service we used to not be great at but actually last two years we have won I think give or take uh we of course had wins at the abbies for SEO cases but we also have uh give or take about 20 different awards on SEO that have come in large mandates that have come in uh growth which has come in over 50% yearonear for four years so you know that you're building a very specialized service similarly with marketing automation and fullfunnel marketing I'm trying to work hard to build all of these various services whether it's marketing automation SEO uh whether it's performance marketing whether it's digital media buying like one area which I don't touch is TV media buying right yet I don't have the you know the ability and capability to do that so while I will do digital media buys I don't touch the TV media buys as much I have a few clients who I do it for but it's not a main stay for me uh similarly performance marketing is a skill set that we have really uh harnessed over the last few years and then you add on to that the digital creative offering the mainline creative offering the social media offering uh production offering and then you are able to basically put together as much of a holistic offering as possible right when you mean what you mean by uh DVCs and TVC so like placements online that's something that you don't do correct so I'm just simplifying it for my audiences so they understand over the over the years all of us agency founders problem for example players back then prices were set by those agencies expenses etc but because so many agencies have entered the market cutting example for our viewers agency I will do it at 70,000 I'll do it at 50 plus a lot of that has also become faster uh how is it that somebody can navigate this space and um really ask for what they think is the right price and as a brand also high quality high give you maybe a bad analogy but I'll give it to you nevertheless in a way agency business restaurant business in a way um skill see ultimately now this is where the analogy stops but at one level the food business is also one which is facing a lot of competition yes um at the same time there are various price points one can operate at from a brand's perspective the strength of the brand is the biggest quality that you can invest in so it will it can certainly become a business differentiator for you and we have seen tons of brands like that i mean some of the customers that we work with are resilient brands simply because or customer eyes closed ultimately investment at the point of truth customer pick versus competition okay ultimately that's what it comes down to price determined okay or is it's a function of the skill that goes into the art that goes into the writing that goes into the thinking that will differentiate whether your brand goes so many miles ahead or whether it stays where it has to m so actually by paying maybe 15 to 20% even 40% extra than the next best guy you could be getting actually skilled people who are moving things significantly forward so I think for a brand owner they have to be very careful actually in a market like this it is difficult for them because they have the temptation to reduce on cost but the quality that goes in may get affected it's the analogy of the restaurant is the quality of the dining experience and uh you know here's the quality of the brand experience how well the brand gets created certain brands you just look at them and you're like magic uh and consistency in every aspect so that is what everybody aderes to or aspires for and as an agency from as a restaurant point of view you have to only keep sharpening your skills m I think honestly in the last few years there are many agencies that have come in but proactive work [Music] these are standing out I'm not saying it's very easy but what I'm trying to say is I see less effort on proactive work to showcase to the markets and then you can ask for what you deserve yeah yeah yeah it's the same thing i think you're very correct in this because I'll be likeity Do they have the band if you go for a better agency at a higher price and same thing for agencies um lower cost because we've seen it for so long right so after 5 years they will be like but like now it's like burnt out I'm not making any money because they tried to save cost so might as well do the good work at the high price if you want to do this in the long run but which disturbs the market I feel like correct you know correct so I made the same observation I think uh in terms of like clients is there I'm understanding I'm saying it in a very easy way etc or of course but uh it's not as I think that's why I say the fundamental is focus on the work the thing I really love is when I was starting schbang I flew to Singapore to meet this gentleman Chris Thomas who was then looking after the uh BBDO business for BBDO is a legendary ad agency which does uh award-winning work and what he showed me is uh so he's looking after the Southeast Asia region India region Middle East region North Africa region so he has that much territory to look after and everything that they were obsessed about is the quality of the work on the diary it was written the work the work the work so it's actually it's all about that so if the work is on top priority and top focus then things can really sort itself out and then of course there are a lot of reflections that I've had on making sure that the work lives with the systems that build the worksh uh so that's a whole different discussion altogether which I've worked on for close to I would say 2 and a half years to build a scalable system to say how do you then take a 1200 100 people to 5,000 what systems would be required for that uh is also important so if you want to scale you need system but at the heart of it you need to love the work that's true and uh to take it to that scale I feel like there is no road map or something that you can take from another business and do it's like you have to build it and then maybe looking at you once you've built it everybody else can follow but with leaders like you I feel like you guys have to set the precedent of how these things are run in larger capacities in a India workforce because in abroad you have those systems and you have these big advertising agencies but India systems processes people you know building is something that is non-existing so you would personally have to build a system to take it from X to you know Y so like it's like that range has to be set by all and creativity they get a little lost because we think something that they just overlook and then it's difficult to scale correct in that so I think that you've done that really well wherein you're like analytical also while being uh creative yeah and how do you balance both the things i've not been able to balance it so there have been phases of my life where I've just been extremely analytical and there have been phases where I've just focused on the work um I'm now trying to bring that balance hopefully it will show in the results in the next few years i think you also have the hands to be able to help you do that right because one person cannot I think you're more analytical from what I understand but I feel like actually I'm fundamentally a creative person i know that fundamentally a creative person but you know to scale a business I feel like sometimes you need more of a analytical mind to take it like up there because creativity obviously is a part but that system processes is more important yeah it's an interesting uh observation anecdote so like I'll zoom back to 2018 okay we are in 2025 now 7 years back uh you know typically you do these personality assessments personality assessment shape based personality assessment"

            "content": "intuitively figure out Triangle squiggle okay square okay or circle okay triangle oriented square relies a lot on emotional relationships to succeed okay to 2018 dominant shapes so I was very clearly a triangle squiggle okay triangle squiggle in 2018 lots of madness but switch back to 2025 if I was looking at the shape intuitively I am more triangle square analytical observation to more vision oriented bottom line oriented how to get to that job fast but with a analytical approach as opposed to a more hyper creative approach i think it's good to know from this that people's personalities can change 100% analytical but over the course of years and with the experiences that you have you can change your shape like into different forms uh if you had to tell me according to this analogy where do I fit in uh definitely squiggle one part for sure um and second part torn between the circle and the triangle because you're also emotionally very aware person to be able to interview a lot of people to speak to them to get to the bottom of them you need to have the emotional intelligence um but at the same time you're also very clear about where you're going so the second one I'm but you can tell me if you choose a circle or a triangle uh yeah maybe by the end of the podcast okay okay so we get back to triangle i think triangle is the one that is more clear on their uh goals and what they want and very um yeah could be possibly i mean we all have some variation of all but what's the dominant one what's the dominant one is what actually drives you so okay probably I would say triangle along with squiggle squiggle for sure that's so squiggle dominant and triangle second is what I would guess interesting okay I have to come back to the agency stuff um what is the kind of client that an agency should not go with and not pick um first and foremost where marketing is not a priority for that company okay because it comes back to that marketriity now it could be very possible that the promoter says okay basically second is wafer thin margin 4% 6% on an average in this industry 75 days is the daily sales outstanding I know it's a reality Invoice [Music] already at the end of the month actually technically 105 days outstanding butes you're a sitting duck right and this is again something for example difficult and number one number two number one second is I feel like too many are coming in your mind no I I actually I think brands are not making so many marketing mistakes now um I think the startups make marketing mistakes uh like like let's say cred okay to spend that crazy kind of money on advertising when you are running you are punting to build a brand which people will stick on to and you are overrelying on brand to drive your product forward i think fundamentally there's something wrong with that i mean actually if you look at it I'm a big believer in that all the elements of the business need to fire together somehow so there needs to be there needs to be synchronicity around elements of the business distribution goes very strong you reach a particular stage on distribution only then you do need marketing right uh because I mean there's a concept of physical availability and mental availability right that if you're available everywhere now in cred's case they could argue that actually technically we are available everywhere because we are on an app store so we need to really increase the net wide to be able to get people on there but then maybe you can actually create that impact in a smaller way test how that's happening and then slowly slowly scale it up I the ability to uh and and then also see if the unit economics are working or no so I mean there's a whole different discussion on the business itself i'm a slightly more conservative player in terms of I believe in the slightly more what one may call the quote unquote conservative style of building a business so I'm not for the entire uh burn and grow model and I don't think it's worked for India and what about all these uh just startups fund because they have so much budgets do you think they are recklessly spending a lot more on marketing that they should Yes i've also seen brands performance for example rely but also it's a catch 22 you know so if you break this down sorry to interrupt you there on this performance part because it's linked to this um see performance alone cannot build a brand right uh you have to be able to build a brand through building brand image brand credibility and I think somewhere what some of these companies are not factoring in is the aspect of time so is it's you throw money at the problem to compress ress time which is what effectively they're doing a good brand would take x many years to build some would argue 10 years to build so you're throwing money at the problem to compress that 10 years to become four years 3 years effectively if you just it's sustainable probably not okay probably not and that is where some of the brands are burning out in the sense that they become shooting stars and then tomorrow you don't know where they are or they don't have uh longer customer lifetime basis now I'm generalizing so I I don't want to be uh unnecessarily called out for saying key you're making a general statement so yes there are certain successes that have showcased uh credible value but by and large time is a factor that I think in the last few years India has forgotten we're a patient country now we have become a uh you know that we are getting left behind on whatever parameters but that's a more a broader question about us as uh society how we view business you know what kind of a mad rush we are in all of those things i think fundamentally we have a very large market and there is enough space for all different kinds of brands to grow if we are focusing on differentiated service and I think lot of the businesses that are being built in India today should be built on basic unit economics working and not trying to do throw money at the problem i agree with you because whether it's people or whether it's brands I've been seeing the same thing again like you said it's a more it's a bigger problem because of the environment we are in wherein everything has to be done so quickly everything has to be bought so quickly there's quick commerce now that is disrupting everything with how fast that everything is available but I really think that it takes time to build those legacy brands if you want or those brands and and people for example it takes years for you to get there and just fastening the process will hamper a lot of the progress so somebody tells me like 2 years 3 years I don't look at a 2 year 3 year I look at what is it in uh for me for the next 10 years and that I know is going to take time you cannot fasten the process and be like now today I want say these many followers or I want this much money or I want to build because it won't it the process supposed to take time you know a lot uh I've seen that happen with with brands also when they're just pushing a lot of money but then again it's like the investors are there and then it just goes according to all of those I guess the investors are smarter than us they're doing their jobs so I'll rely on their good judgment but I'm just commenting on what I see yeah I know I think there's some particular that that can scale and become so fast but it won't apply to everybody by large so everybody's trying it out I guess and also yeah but I guess I mean this is another topic we're going into other direction altogether but back to agency no I understand that that could be a biggest uh mistake that uh and I wouldn't have seen it that way that they are spending a lot more um okay tell me that when you hire somebody at Schbang uh what is something that you look at in everybody like that one trait that has to be there so the big thing that we are looking for a lot more now is uh and I think this is not a new answer but it's basically learnability adaptability and the hunger for growth if you have learnability adaptity hunger for growth we want you in the team and uh particularly at the entry levels so at the entry levels you want that uh you want people who come with a passionate can do attitude uh and who've demonstrated the ability to go beyond what they are asked to do in their uh education period so whether that's projects whether that's um you know responsibilities of clubs that they may have undertaken things like that or at higher levels we are only looking for skill okay so think of it as a football analogy that you know how what's your skill on a particular parameter that you're being hired for so if you're in performance marketing what's your skill there if you're in marketing automation what's your skill to set up flows so on and so forth if you're if you're a generalist on production then how strong is your network what's your skill on turning around a particular shoot that may be requiring a crunch timeline um if you're a uh AI person then what's your skill specifically with APIs so that's more at the mid and higher levels it's skill along with the attitude but at the entry levels it's more attitude who is a kind of person that definitely should not join the agency world i I think agency world is for a lot of uh different kinds of people because you get a lot of varied exposure uh particularly and within the agency also actually I think if I look back and I see people entering my office I think a lot of them uh get access to the pulse of how business works they get access to how pulse of how teams can tick together they get access to how consumers can be spoken to they get access to how craft and aesthetics come together so I think it's a very good uh breeding ground for u any kind of person who may want an entrepreneurial career or a large career in management or in branding or in marketing uh so you know I think it's good for all of those kind of people basically yeah but what you shouldn't come to is if you're a deeply technical person uh which there are very few of in India so like for example the one person who thinks when you think of deep tech in India is Angad Darani like somebody of his stature extremely scientific extreme depth on uh wanting to solve a scientific problem an agency is not going to do that but if you want communication to solve a problem if you want branding to solve a problem if your approach to solving a problem is through communication brand if you want to know how to manage things well the discipline and rigor of meeting targets That's very good in an agency setup okay i wanted to ask you that if you are building a brand today to up market based brand where I'm the co-founder of archives which is a tote based uh totes that we build okay and I'm very happy with how we built out that brand the co-founders of that are Gorav Bhya and Pratima Bhya gorav used to be the ex head of LBMH in India and uh Pratima used to do a lot of operations for Nika fashion uh we have had that tote loved and revered by uh Priyanka Chopra has been spotted using it tara Sutary has been spotted flaunting it uh Anna Winto has sworn by it uh Sienna Miller has been seen wearing it who's who international and Indian celebrities basically the aesthetic is so so I mean just fantastic so and and the brand story is also I dream in India so there is I dream in India there is a I dream in Pondicherry there is a I dream in wonderust so the idea of travel as a piece that you can put into your little tote which is the dream of what you experience in that place and you carry it with you day in day out is what archives is about so it's a very strong brand story it's a very quirky logo with the monkey that we have and we're very strong Instagram page with the kind of storytelling that we're doing i think uh there was an article the economic times wrote about the forerunners of the bag players in India and uh the u Indian totes who would lead that charge and they've said archives would be the first to do that so I mean it's been widely spoken whether it's AD Vogue uh Harpers everybody's spoken very very fondly of it so I would build it more depending on the category but for this category I think he's done a very very good job extremely aesthetic design first principles design first thinking on the way the product is put together uh lean operations darling of the press loved by celebrities under the radar not shouting too much so that's one brand and the second brand uh which I've tried to follow the playbook of how I would build a brand is on level supermind so level supermind is uh we try to focus a lot on the product and we got the Google play app of the year for 2023 uh so that was a good testament uh but again in terms of how we are building that particular brand is to look at uh make it a contentled brand so last week we had one of our reels hit it was a good moment for us about 25 million views on a reel uh we built a podcast platform where we speak to different people in the space of mental health and mental wellness uh we've focused a lot on being very very consumer centric around building the product so uh typically is 50 consumers spoken to every week to take inputs on how to further improve the product we focused on reviews and ratings a lot so on Android and uh Apple we are uh very highly rated with the kind of volumes that we have so I think between these two between aesthetic and between let's call it mathematic so aesthetic and mathematic these two are bringing the elements well together so I'm satisfied with the way it's going but and then I'm going to see brand right because you would be the ideal person to start a brand i would assume would be like my question to you but you have done it already so and I follow level superminds progress so that has been a good uh learning uh to do that yeah I need to I need to buy one i don't have one advertising budget H&M so it was uh H&M's Diwali campaign and it was fantastic film that had a multi-star cast uh Manushi Chiller Isha Talvwar Jim Sarb all of them in what was a uh whimsical variation between what is reality and what is your dream okay uh for Diwali so brighter than ever was the thematic of H&M that year and the whole film was written around an elevator that you could enter uh and at every floor that you got out you had a different experience uh basically your clothes what you were wearing and what you saw outside the elevator was reflecting what you were wearing inside so it was little like a true fashion film uh crazy whimsical fun so extremely good on production uh that's one of the productions that we did which was our largest production that was good now tell me a certain budget without naming the brand what is the biggest budget that you have worked on on a campaign biggest production budget that I worked on on a campaign is about 5 crores okay of production that's the biggest budget that I have worked on um I think everybody was talking about the dream 11 budget this time probably six times of that um so I haven't had the chance of working on a dream 11 kind of budget but the largest one that I worked on is in the range of 5 crores and the largest media spend that I would have done annually for a brand would be in the range of 25 to 30 crores this sounds like an FMCG brand yeah yeah that's a lot of um pressure also right to handle the the that amount of money for somebody else and running it and making sure that that other person is able to then make money through the money that they are investing through you and I've also noticed that when it comes to performance one small mistake on an ad can make things go wrong yeah uh and how has that ever happened yeah it's happened tell me an incident without naming the brand or uh spend you have to give the money back so you may try few tricks you'll be like okay on the other spend I'll be more efficient and then I'll recover some of that spend but pretty much per month which was again in that startup burn phase oh so that company shut down okay cuz it was not sustainable if I was the promoter then what I would have done is not spend that much probably spend oneten the amount to increase the rass but they were on a certain but you can tell your client that right you're the partner to the brand yeah but see certain things when you're spending that much you just want an efficient execution partner or efficient execution team because they've gone and sold a particular vision to the investors of how much scale they're going to hit okay so it's baked into the business plan i have nobody to have a point of view on that for that client and now that's reduced significantly or those teams have gone in-house now what do you do in a case where you don't align with the brand values or brand actions that they want to take do you then think that it's a interesting question but I'm more on the latter"

now but in every workforce you'll have a bunch of people who really want to get ahead you'll have a bunch of people who want to keep it easy and you'll have a bunch of people who don't give a damn yep so you will have all three now what percentage are skewed inside your organization that's your responsibility but I don't think like I I mean I just feel like I don't I think this whole Jenz is a particular way is is I feel like overwritten about okay i think I would say that I mean maybe at the risk of being cancer by Jenzi I feel like you're just like the previous generation you just consume different things and you just you just look different look different look different ah he's going to look different i'm playing it safe no but like I feel like there is a difference because um Jenz's come with maybe a lot more opinion and a lot more staunch opinion which is very good because they give you that kind of input that millennials maybe in a certain way would not u millennials come with more of a hardworking sustainably long persistent journey that I feel like because Jenzi has a lot of options they don't have and I know I'm kind of generalizing but there is that difference and across if you put in if you yesterday's millennials in today's environment they would behave the same i don't think it's a there would be some different traits for them yeah i mean by and large the whole population you put it all together in one mixer it would turn out exactly the same so it's like I feel like it's it's the time that has changed not the fundamental people that have changed also you have to understand that for us to understand that India is a lot richer than it was in terms of disposable income m uh so you've gotten used to a certain taste of life and you want to enjoy that taste of life also because you got way more things that you're exposed to you're way more opinionated as a result of that because you're a lot more exposed so you have a sharper point of view you grown up in a content first generation so I think people are always people are always people and the time is different right how do you balance working with a family member because you work with your brother how is that like I'm sure it's not like do you take that home does Has that ever happened where you have taken the work back home because it's part of your family yeah it it can get tricky especially with brothers it can get tricky um especially also if you have like a if you're the older brother or the younger brother in my case I'm the older brother so uh I'm sure it's sometimes difficult for my younger brother to deal with me um and similarly I mean for him as well for me also for me to deal with him on certain things like I can't there's certain things I have to keep my decorum on in terms of how direct I can be um so I think sometimes possibly if I had to just be very very precise about it with family there's a strength which is that you you know you're always safe and with family the the other side is that you probably can't be as direct as you would be with would be otherwise necessarily because you have to keep the decorum of the relationship uh at the same time if there's a genuine desire or an impact to serve the same goal uh then you can achieve that and then there's a I guess you know with family a lot of things are implicit you got to feel it so if you feel safe secure you feel like we're walking towards the same thing then it's all good right okay um another one on that uh your co-founder Akshai Gunani uh has left schbang after 10 years Was that hard on you professionally and also emotionally because it's been a long journey emotionally probably not um professionally I think definitely he left a lot of uh strong he had a lot of strong contributions to what we built at Shebang over the years uh so I have respect for all the contributions that he had towards the towards the journey of Schbang uh so from that professional standpoint those professional achievements will always be respected and and counted upon and uh emotionally it wasn't probably and you know emotionally it wasn't a very it was it didn't impact me as much personally it did not because you kept your personal and emotions separately at work because when you work with somebody for that long I feel like you do get invested in them a little bit personally and emotionally perhaps perhaps so You're right about the fact that you could get invested personally and emotionally into a person in this particular case I wasn't as much probably also because I've been through an experience where I have uh you know in my previous agency also worked very closely with co-founders um and then went on to leave to build on another enterprise so I think my uh makeup is probably such that I always saw myself and and and I was the the captain driving the ship so I continue with my responsibility uh I had certain co-conspirators who were helping me on that journey i continue to have them uh the role changes the responsibility changes you have respect for the contributions that were there behind and you're grateful for them and thankful for them but I I didn't reach a stage where I was emotionally connected charged in that sense do you think that that's important when you're at work wherein you have to keep it separate from having anything to do with them personally it'll help in situations like this if they move on honestly it depends the kind of person you are and the kind of experiences you had you asked me when I was uh 20 years old when I was doing my first agency we got along like a pack of cards we would we would have this uh immense sense of uh deep brotherhood to really you know bear your utmost self to your colleagues and your co-founders um and then it then I started seeing that it's becoming more towards I'm also bearing it towards my colleagues and then we're going we're going into a different topic now of boundaries but like you know where the u so like I mean I give an example like we used to have bets where If something didn't happen my colleague would bet against me that I'd be in boxers the entire day roaming around office versus that so it's like a very frat boy culture probably a lot of the things that we did back then would leave us canceled today i've seen that and I've seen the ability to build with a uh longer vision and I think the ability to build with a longer vision to be dispassionate about the I mean you have to respect the strength of the relationship you have to be able to connect at a very deeply personal level but also recognize that work is not family family is a lot deeper in terms of personal relationship so I have understood and learned that so um for me I'm very clear that where the where the depth of my personal relationships go where the extremely deep personal relationships go is outside of the workplace uh yes you may have one or two people in your workplace that you are deeply connected with but that's at a personal level that's not at a work level necessarily it has certain advantages that you can bring into work and certain disadvantages as well but fundamentally when you're building the workplace you're in service of the vision and my vision at Schbang is very clear i named to you the six major holding groups which are French Japanese American British and there is no in major global Indian network across the world which is what I am building okay"

        },

            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "that uh that was uh probably a period of a lot of growing up for me in terms of certain skill on managing public relations i think no doubt and I've apologized for it it was not in good taste uh what I feel a bit of a consolation prize is uh 2024 cervical cancer was among the top three search terms on Google so it's a bit of a consolation prize but it doesn't take away from the fact that the work wasn't necessarily in good taste i also reflected a bit on the work which is that actually if we had found a woman called Punam Pande who had actually died of cervical cancer and we had put that out and the real Punam Pandy would have said is that the there is actually somebody called Punam Pande just not me okay and I'm forcing you to take awareness of this issue so if really the fact was a fact then it would have played out better yeah it would have played out a lot more like intelligently I guess uh it was deceitful around death which people didn't appreciate so what I learned in a nutshell is um I learned that actually if you look at your list of stakeholders h and fortify your stakeholders what I the first thing I was advised at that time was that fortify the things that are closest to you so fortify your entire workforce mhm uh it happened on a Saturday on a sun Saturday of course full day I was at the office Sunday full day I was at the office Monday morning we had a meeting with the entire workforce of schbang telling them that look we've made a mistake this is what has happened this is how it's transpired this is what we are doing and probably you're going to face a lot of shame in dealing with your clients and your family members so here is what has already been done to talk to your clients so on Sunday night I sent personally a message to over 600 different clients saying this has happened we take responsibility we request you to please let work go on with your teams as is they don't know anything about it and here is what we are doing to make amends m so what happens is that anybody who's working in this company under my leadership should not face the wroth of a mistake that is caused by a single set of individuals because yes we are one and the impact of we are one is also if one person makes a mistake it's a it's it's on everybody so some people are uncomfortable how do I even discuss this with somebody else so the moment you've taken responsibility there the weight is off their shoulder to apologize so that was one of the first things we did which is the circle closest to you your team your workforce is what you first fortify so that's the first thing that we did we did also a whole host of committees on fortifying how this doesn't happen again from the investigation of how that did we launched an internal investigation on exactly breaking down how this went by and what steps we need to take in the future so that's part of the team the second was the clients so uh certain clients had more concerns we lost also a few clients post that because it was a it was a public relations nightmare to be associated with uh somebody like us at that time was difficult on some clients as well we had a client who was in the ethics committee of a large corporate said that I just can't continue to work with you uh so it's a loss loss loss of uh significant business so um the second was to fortify with the clients have open dialogue with the clients uh talk to them about how much they want to investigate into what we are doing and how this came about transparently that was the second and then the third lesson was that the things that you can't control just don't respond to that so in the middle of a media storm the only thing you can do is duck stand your ground say that yes I acknowledge there was a mistake stick to that and nothing else don't say anything else h uh there were a whole host of other things that could have broken down which is probably a discussion for another day we're too raw in it there were things about um you know potentially uh the person in question saying even more wrong things about us because there were some of those things as well uh there was actually one of the one of the things that I was most upset about was uh a damning article on LinkedIn by a gentleman called Mahesh Morti um now I used to look up to Mahesh Morti you know we speaking about mentors i used to look up to Mahesh Morti i saw him first in 2006 uh founder of a company called Pinstorm back in the day one of the pioneers of the digital marketing space he wrote a damning article saying look you've got actually a client in this space so you've done this work for a client and you've done it in the garb of a public service campaign but exclient has funded you oh it was firstly factually totally incorrect he's connected a few dots but factually totally incorrect uh conjecture labeled as fact so I called him up i said you know sir I you know I've actually followed your work since 2006 and I'm in a bit of a soup and what you've said I need your help because it's totally untrue and I just would wish that you pull it down right now um because it's not true it may maybe good content for your LinkedIn but uh it's going to do a lot of reputational damage for me and it's going to do a lot of damage for my business and he turned around and he almost like an investigative journalist he asked me prove to me that this is wrong so then I knew I was dealing with a person who is more interested in being relevant uh than in really uh perhaps being a a person who is a champion of the industry uh I had to face the brunt of that it was what he wrote about in LinkedIn was in economic times the next day uh lots of business loss so uh there were some things I couldn't control him i couldn't control the press i couldn't control uh to our people I could give them strength and transparency and acknowledgement of the issue uh to our clients I could give the same and um definitely big thanks to all the clients who really supported us through the period there was lots of clients who said yes this is a one-off we know this is not what you guys stand for and it's a mistake reflect on it and move on there are lots of those messages and then there were the few where it just didn't align with their values and they pulled out uh and few which got dragged into public controversy and pulled out so um so yeah it was a difficult period probably the hardest uh public relations crisis if you may that I had to face"
