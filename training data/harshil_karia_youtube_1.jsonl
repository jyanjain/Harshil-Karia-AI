            "content": "school sure and the 11th standard you know I came back came out of the 10th standard and then here I am in the 11th standard so this great school that you know the Amani familyes built up um what was so amazing about it was the first time I felt pushing myself to think you know so it forced me to think it forced me to read it was in one summer that they gave us saying before you come to school you have to read 12 books so you know it it it starts the process of U of of questioning things um and then what happened early is that you know you take that through college and I was taking that through college so what happened with college is that I didn't I didn't choose to go like some of you know our peers we didn't choose to go outside India to study we said you know there's a huge uh there's some huge lessons to learn here soes like you saw no not not not so much but you know also I mean also I wasn't 100% sure what I wanted to do so because you're not 100% sure what you want to do you sit here and you see you will make the most of your time here so through the three years of college in jind I was doing College from 8 to 12 and then 1200 to 9 I was doing some sort of an internship so my first internship was coincidentally in advertising with this company called densu which is a giant in our business right now uh and I used to go in there and I used to watch observe how they structure their workplace and I said you know I love this business I saw this interesting movie called Art and copy uh and I said I want to be in this business second year I was in a company so I stopped going to the advertising company for one year second year you are in the business of U you know we we were trying to do this ymax boxes all over Bombay so we were setting up ymax boxes all over Bombay so I said I like advertising want to do something with tech and advertising and the third year I set up uh you know this great guy Rajiv dingra he was uh he runs a company called what consult right now he used to run a Blog called what blog that time web advertising technology so you know that was the birth of the tech Crunch and Mashable movement and uh which was this this was 2007 and we were going to conferences like Proto dotin underground where you're interviewing Minas just sort of come alive uh you know so many flip carts just come alive and you're interviewing the founder so I was basically a podcaster then uh creating podcast and writing blogs for one year there so those were really interesting times and I said you know there's three years of this so then I said you know I will study this advertising thing do these internships and then I got out of uh college and all of these experiences in college I'm like you know now I got to put this all together um and very honestly the thing is that starting salary at the time was some 15 16,000 bucks so I said what's my opportunity cost do I for if even if I take the risk and even if I try to do something on my own I'm you know I'm not going to be losing too much uh so I fortunately we I was not in a position where losing that 15 16,000 bucks would mean the world to me so I said okay let me give it a risk and that's when you know we got together four of us uh friends to set up this company foxymoron what was the intention that you all will do social media marketing for Brands yeah so when I joined I I was the last guy to join in you know so they were doing some experiments with doing some branding work for people some t-shirt printing bus and then you know I was obviously watching the stuff with blog and I said to them that you know bring me in I will bring in the social media marketing element so I came in with that approach and uh then we essentially decided to steer and said let's make social media Mainstay um and that time the big lessons I had at the time you know we were trying to build a business uh for we were essentially trying to build what we didn't know at the time we were essentially trying to build a Services business right and what we needed to do was you know is for for a market which was Unknown People didn't know social media marketing so I still remember that we used to go you know take the train from VT and go on the central line or take the train from churchgate and go on the Western Line trying to meet company after company and we used to do this 100 slide presentation on what is social media marketing wow so we used to just try to educate companies on that and then you know small companies to mediumsized companies to then we got our first Big Break uh Cadbury somebody decided and said that ho you know come and meet I don't mind if you come and meet so we did this whole 100 side presentation with him he said okay looks like this guy has some uh you know he's worth working with he knows what he's talking about he knows what he's talking about maybe he doesn't know what he's talking about but he's worth working with so we got you know we got a contract simultaneously from cbes and our first other contract was with Cosmetics company Maybelline New York uh and they were both working with large Legacy agencies you know uh Maybelline New York at the time working with lar Universal part of the ipg group big American company and oil was working with Cadbury uh so good chances you got to make you know those little chances that you get you got to make the most of so on Maybelline we did a great job we had 6X of what their previous guy was giving them wow in terms of absolute output if you look at you know uh the impact on the money spent and the output earned and the impact on sales was 6X of what they were getting earlier so they said okay fine we're going to now sign you on an annual ual contract and same thing kind of happened with cbes and then once you're in these two groups then it's automated it's automated because the other guys are talking to you saying that okay now you are good let me talk to you about my brand also so in Cadbury's after our first brand Was Bonneville chocolate dark chocolate and uh then the other guy came in and he said you I want to talk to you about Bonita so it was a nice uh nice time working on that stuff and then of course with L'Oreal we got a lot of work with uh I mean Maybelline is owned by the L'Oreal group yeah so then we got L'Oreal Paris and we got gher and then we got I mean all they've got about 30 Brands I 30 is too much but they they've got a lot of Brands was this also like partly first mover's Advantage like I'm sure you hustled like there's no question about that but I remember you guys dude there was no one else that I remember of like so there were actually there's a guy you know there's some of those guys still now um um so Rajiv who I used to work with with what blog yeah Rajiv ran then what consult at the time okay uh Rajiv had a very successful exit with what consult sold to densu and he's a very rich man now and now moving on to his next venture um there's the guys from Miriam and social wavelength yeah two fantastic gentlemen you know sanj Sanjay meta and Harish tiala in the second Innings of Entrepreneurship so you know you rarely get to see that so they were like what I called at that time the Grand Old Men of social media so they were there and then there was rupak saluja with his Jack in the Box yeah yeah uh so there was a lot of Independence and of course you know we work our industry is such that we have a lot of established players also so even hilvi was doing social media but you know yes it was a bit of first mover Advantage but I would say a lot of it was Luck first and then there was also a lot of perseverance you know in in sort of putting that together and I think we had a great culture in terms of the kind of talent that we accumulated"

reasonably well now we've got you know by by a third party we've got in uh sort of ranked as one of the fastest growing companies for the last 3 years so I mean not to like not it's not a big deal there a long way to go but you know somewhere you come you've done some things right uh but at the time I think I was so I left I was also I had a I had a pretty bad habit at the time you know the habit of smoking hash we've all been there yeah so I had a pretty bad habit at the time i' just putting it out there and I've spoken with this on the podcast in the past also I I had a bad habit of Edibles like marijuana laced Edibles so I think that's a bunch of us entrepreneurs and it's not just you and me it's a lot of ENT so now I'm I'm out of it completely uh and you know we have spoken about this and that's what one of things we connected over also but at the time I remember I think I think I got damn lucky because I was out I was earning a good nice fat salary I was you know somebody's willing to buy our company I decided to get out I think somewhere the fact that I'm saying that I messed up the exit is also that I didn't fully think it through uh you know I wasn't necessarily thinking it through fully um I wasn't kind of seeing the consequences the ramifications I wasn't you know seeing protecting myself also fully uh so from that standpoint where I was there is and and at the same time yes I was seeing a very I was seeing I was very excited about what we could build further so I think the you know one of the reasons I I can say what worked out is was there was a very clear Vision on what we wanted to achieve as shebang and you know what gaps we could fill and what kind of people we want to hire and what kind of culture we want to set so you you have to have some kind of a setup to show the largest customers in the country that look you know you can trust me with your mandate because I mean essentially why do clients why do large companies hire agencies because they think that they can do a particular job better and why do agencies survive or succeed or exist in the in the world of business is because if they can actually do it better yeah and and if if my client's business wins yeah then I win yeah 100% whatever they've hired me for I just got to make sure that I am you know one of those Catalyst to make sure that their company grows and that's that's what I got to keep doing you're like a soldier for higher that's you're a high level it's a very well put actually it's very well put that's pretty much what agencies do and service based businesses do yeah so coming back to the point so we had we we our first office when we put in we put in a floor plan of 10,000 ft first office with 40 people hired on day one with not a single customer to back me so I put in my savings and I put that into putting this business together so I was for the first 6 months bricks because you can put it on a business plan you can write that you know in the first year you will have a working capital loss of 1 CR rupees you can put that on paper but when it actually happens and it's your own money and it's bleeding out then you then you you know nobody can explain that feeling to you yeah because then things start going crazy so I then in my first year and a half I was we were we were bleeding money as per the business plan we were were gaining customers also we was I mean our Gap was falling but you know we said that we want an initial outlay because we want the customers to trust us and we want the biggest customers to trust us and actually two customers trusted us at the first time you know one was PHX Industries and one was godri consumer PHX is a conservative Cindi company godish is a conservative Pari company so I felt that's great because you know when you have two giant companies which are conservative backing a new house you know it sends a good great signal to the market that you know the old Legacy guys say okay this guy is okay to work with so but obviously you're bleeding money so that was really difficult difficult in the sense that to be honest I also went and found a buyer to buy my business and I said that you know you can take maybe 51% of it give me all my recovery of my original money back god um he said okay but I negotiated that contract with him for 1 and a half years and I put a law firm for I spent about 3 lakh rupes on a law firm while negotiating that contract this guy who wanted to buy me was one of the again one of the Legends in our industry uh I think best 3 lakh rupees I spent in my life because over this one and a half years I really got inside the mind of what a legend thinks like because the way he was negotiating the contract I was trying to understand what is going on in his mind uh and you know that's the way I always try to learn because let me learn by observing what my opposite party is I think that's most of us you know as how do how do we learn and as you work closer and closer quarters with people you get to understand them better and then you think back and reflect saying okay if I was to do this here's how I do it so you form your approach but that was the first one and a half years very scary very difficult mentally uh you are earning a you know approximately you may be earning five to six lakh a month to then you pay yourself a salary of 20,000 so it does a lot of things to you what it does is it forces you to get disciplined it forces you to you know sort of rethink what are the important things you should be putting priority on you become more disciplined more monk like in a way uh so that's when all of the you know automatically all of the hash smoking and all of that went away got it so you start going inside because you start becoming how old are you brother uh at the time so this was between 27 and 30 this whole phase I'm 32 now"

            "content": "I'm I mean I I'm not so old yeah I'm just too I'm young so I either I feel like I don't have lessons I I just want to keep I want to keep improving myself I think maybe that's a lesson if you if you may like I feel like the moment you chase constant growth growth constant Excellence constant like you know I could be better you never you know you never feel like what I've got is enough not from a point of view of lack of gratitude but from the point of view of look I have so much more to do like stay hungry but never be greedy yeah yeah I think that's one lesson the other lesson is what you put in is very important so what you put into your body is very very important I have a I you know I thought I'd say this to you because I have something I'm dealing with right now which I really want to get rid of um I ate six chocolates last night you know I I can't get over my sugar I I remember speaking about this when we met also you know so that's what I'm trying to deal with but what you put in like so I started you know sort of the kind of food we started putting in I I cut out meat from my diet I felt like that made a big difference to me I cut out the smoking I cut out the alcohol now it's been some time and I see myself right I see myself waking up earlier uh I see myself so it's it's I'm trying to live I I feel like I am living a life I don't need a holiday from right 100% And you know yeah and that's that's basically you know you somebody told me actually what hit the nail on the head for me for the smoking was uh you're trying to get high because you're not high enough on life M and I said no no that's not true you know that's not true I I'm really high on life I love what I'm doing uh so you know so that's that was important to me and then it's made a big difference I feel now so you know hopefully in the next few years we don't read something where you know this guy's back on it but uh but that's why I thought it's important for me to put it out also because it is made a big difference to my memory my cognition the speed at which I work you know the clarity with which I think so I think what you put in is very very important it's a you know so it's it's it's important 100% dude that you are what you eat that's part of it I also feel that dude because you're a meditate when you uh kind of follow the meditative lifestyle which is no meat no alcohol no intoxicants your meditation become more powerful meditation literally adds information to your mind um it's a very spiritual concept uh this is something that people who are listening to it also may not understand this is something you will understand if you meditate for at least half an hour for like a year or two you'll be like okay I think in different ways there are new thoughts in my head just I don't know I don't know what it does do you have anything to say about that do you feel like it adds information to your head have you experienced clity okay you know you are so it I think what I feel when I'm in meditation the only thing I always go back to it brings you back to your purpose so you're always peeling off the layers and you're going back to your purpose you're going back to okay I was I am here for this what's your purpose dude so right now I mean there's a little more but I should not be speaking about that little more till I've not crossed the first path but this India to the world is my purpose right now you know this whole idea of taking this huge Army of supremely talented greatly principled well cultured talented creative technologically sound Indians from here to what we're building at shebang to all over the world and bringing the best of the world to India that's what my purpose is right now crazy that's step one and I there is something more beyond that but let me let me first get past this then I have the then I have the license to be able to even talk about what's after that okay so I don't know how far in we are uh in your five learnings of Life yeah they keep growing self- Improvement together that's one what you put in is important yeah what you put in next sense of purpose we spoke about that so that's the third yeah um I think the other big lesson that I've had is I think we need to have all of us need to have uh you know an ally in terms of in terms of something else beyond our work that keeps us really fulfilled and a person no an ally in terms of like I have music you know so I love I love doing music I'm now uh you know what I'm I'm learning to play the sitar and I'm doing my vocals so I love doing that and I feel like that energizes me creatively so I feel like that's another big lesson I was not I I used to you know just long story short is I was one of those kids whose mom forced him to do music class when he was young and then hated it I rediscovered it at 29 found a guru who's you know got me back into classical music so I feel like that also helps you become more grounded not not grounded but just more interesting as a person for yourself got it uh so that so this purpose have something beyond the work that's fourth and I would say the other big learning is uh the the really big learning is I think you have to learn to respect people for the beauty that is in them if you can see the beauty in people and that is what I'm you know that's a new lesson but if you can see the beauty inside people and unlock most of that beauty especially for a service entrepreneur yeah 100% that's the most important thing get the best out of people and accept them even with their weaknesses I feel it's not accept I feel see what's beautiful in them okay just focus on the good stuff yeah because you don't need to accept anything if they are if they show you what's great about them all the time"
