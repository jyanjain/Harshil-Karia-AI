lot of growth and then 202 through 2022 we had to break a lot of things and 2023 we've had actually a very good year to rebuild the systems of the company to be able to handle the 1200 people now going up to even more than 1200 people that I'm sure all these systems can now handle close to 2,000 to 2,500 people so covid was definitely good for us in the sense the market demand came we pitched we pitched well we got business um but at the same time our organizational design needed to scale which we weren't able to scale at the same Pace three major things we did one is we divided the company into multiple small business units or strategic business units sbus that we called them within sbus we had multidisciplinary functions functioning within the same sbu so in the same sbu you'll have if it's a creative sbu you will have account planning you will have servicing you'll have creative uh all and art all within the same sbu if you're in Tech then you will have your project manager your uh technical manager your coders and your uiux all within the same sbu so we started forming different different SB each of these sbus became roughly 80 to 100 people each then we started really you know what were the problems that we had our actually very basic problems so I can't even tell you that which you know some Jadu we did our problems were that we didn't have a stringent system to control over hiring so we put systems in place for that because we we suddenly started exploding in terms of like uh you know the we suddenly started explosing exploding business we also started exploding a number of people joining the organization so if I had to be very honest with you when we were at the end of 2022 almost 1200 people I think we were 8800 we were to be 850 people we were roughly 350 people too many as a result of that your controls and your cost management is a challenge so we basically put strong controls for that that now we do you know there are few things we measure at our quarterly business reviews which we are going into next week so every quarter we are managing uh and we are measuring are three four things one is we we set out a business plan at the start of the Year where are we against side business plan not just in terms of new business one but also in terms of Team size budgeted for and uh salary budget deployed so at the business level we are managing measuring that then we are measuring how much is our shortfall how much is the gap that we have to cover so that each of the sbus has that intelligence data given by a central team they don't have to do that they are given all that data then we are measuring the scope versus delivery of the client so if the client has given us a scope of 100 pieces have we delivered 100 have we deliv 102 have we delivered 120 have we delivered 140 so we see the variance where there is lesser delivered it's a red flag for us so that also helps us track and see at a client level where we are not delivering up to the mark then we are able to track you know kpi or engagement score or you know we spoke about those different different kind of services having different kpi so we track those kpis in the quarter Business Review so if the kpi is below the Benchmark or is below the industry average again red flag so you have measures for red flag coming in have you not given scope enough to the client that's a red flag have you not delivered on your kpis that's a red flag then we are measuring the cat client satisfaction we are measuring the net promoter score so as is your client faction low you know which is lower than what it's supposed to be is your net promoter score actually poor that's a red flag so uh and then there's a few other metrics like the overall team mood score because we also use AI to measure the mood score of every team um then the pitch conversion rate how many pitches did each team do and what is the conversion rate on those pitches uh you know what is the award conversion rate how many awards did you apply for how many did you win so it's actually a whole bunch of metrics that we are tracking and also we are tracking attrition so how many people left your team and what is the average attrition of the company are you way above way below so all of these metrics actually help the manager stay in control of the business the head of the sbu to stay in control of the business so if they then in control of the business then there are lesser chances of you falling into a risky situation where your business becomes a bit more uh you know kind of starts shaking so so those are the things that we are now uh building into the organization to make it very resilient and very uh you know like while we can continue our growth we have grown well this year also 35% growth we have a lot of inquiries which we convert the pitches so again like I said we track the pitch conversion rate we track very carefully the pipeline that we have so we do all of these things but now we are just making sure that whatever we get we don't lose at all really deep ins sides there thank you um so what does a shabang digital marketing pitch look like what goes in that winning presentation okay so the pitch usually typically starts with ABC so a is audience uh second is a brand and third is a category uh or actually in the form of ACB so audience category and brand but like we say ABC and then we reorient the ab a ACB so audience typically will look at like you know for the brand what is the audience exactly like we then go under the skin of the audience typically in the pitch we will do audience interviews we will go and do focus groups we will go and uh you know scan social conversations we will scan what people are saying about the particular you know that particular audience on e-commerce website what reviews they are talking about then we will crunch you"

            "content": "know 12 13,000 reviews together and use AI to come with the commonalities of that audience like what is it that they're really looking after so we have really good sense of the audience because normally a client will buy your service when they know that you understand the audience very well that's one part of it second your client will buy a service when they know you understand their brand very well so the second part will be brand where we will decode not just the brief but what we understand of the brand and like you know what are the uh you know like visual guidelines what do they say what is the brand personality what is the brand archetype uh you know like what does that particular brand uh uh you know like how how according to us what is the equity of the brand you know what are the consumers saying about the brand uh what are the most words used when referred to the brand what is the current image versus the desired image so that's the second part which is the brand and third is the category so what is the competition doing what are the trends in the category how much is the competition spending versus you uh you know like then yeah ex effectively those kind of things how much is the how much is the category growing by so a lot of annual reports a lot of financial reports we will study on the basis of that so that gives us a good understanding of category that category is you know uh how is the sale happening in the category who is it through dealers is it retailers Distributors e-commerce who is the most dominant channel uh what is the big trigger for Consumer purchase within that category so all that we'll put down in the ABC and then that is finally put together to identify the problem and then the pitch has the solution to the problem Creative Solutions creative strategic solution fantastic that's nice that's really good one um it always takes that one big client to scale the agency how did shabang back the first big digital marketing client something that changed the game of organization so our philosophy from day one has been that no single client should be that big to dictate The Fortunes of the agency so our first client that we had we were fortunate that we had a client PHX pipes and second client we had godri Industries both these clients were very strong Legacy names that gave a very strong trust to the market to other big companies that they can also work with us so I would say that the more Legacy names you can get behind you and tough players and longlasting players in the market you can get to work with you and if they can give you their uh testimonial or credibility uh then that's a good way to grow the agency I think anchoring on one client alone is a risky strategy Legacy Brands is what you're saying is the way to go forward I mean and Legacy Brands work for us now in today's market you could choose that I want to be tuned for funded brands or I want to be tuned for family managed brands or I want to be tuned for like uh you know uh small scale going to medium scale so you can choose a particular Niche because there are so many different different niches we chose this particular Niche because we felt that we were best suited for it plus it would be profitable in the long run plus we be able to maintain certain kind of pricing and build the team a certain way uh but each kind of client I would say try to own a certain DNA of client like family managed business I think for example is not very well managed in India today you know Regional players if you say talk about South specific agency that is not you know we don't have Undisputed King on that so each of the regions of India also needs to have a Undisputed King and then you'll talk about uh you know that small scale to medium basically agencies go like companies which are 10 CR turnover going to 100 CR turnover how well can you serve them so each one has a um you know I think each each market niche of India can have a agency leader good thoughts there I think some really great insights with respect to uh how do we go figure out uh niches with respect not just the categorization of the industry but uh how much they're earning like the way you said family managed businesses so I think there's a lot of these uh deeper work that you guys have done to figure out with industry or who are we chasing in the market that's amazing um so shebang in London Dubai and Amsterdam I think Dubai is no we are not yet in Dubai I do see that on the website that we have mentioned Amsterdam timing and the Dubai timing so timing we put we want to be in Dubai soon yeah so we aspiring to be there fine I'm so proud to see an Indian digital marketing agency becoming in MNC which is very unlikely to happen uh what's our goal and why didn't we partner with someone why on our own okay so goal is very simple and very clear uh in this business the global players are either French you can say Havas publes they are either American Omnicom they either British wpp S4 they are either Japanese densu hakuhodo um there is no major Indian player which has a presence across the world which has India as a headquarters which uses the best of Indian creativity skill and talent and Ingenuity to deliver to clients all over the world uh so our mission very early on was we said stated out saying that we will be from India to the world and bring the best of the creative talent in the world to India and that is a mission that we are on uh I said this statement in 201718 when we were hardly a 150 member team and that has helped to keep going forward right now also we are small spec to where we want to be so we will keep going why we are choosing to do this by ourselves versus without a partner because per se the industry functions in a way where you hardly have a partner with somebody you either get bought by them so you need to run agency with a Clear Vision uh on where you want to be um there are many of my peers who have decided to sell the agencies and cashed out right uh I think most of them take the track in Mumbai is what I see yeah yeah which is good it's there's no problem with that but I think I'm very clear that we are here to stay for the longer Hall and we will build this out over the next 20 25 years this uh India to the world so when not building it up to be acquired you have to serve yeah we won't be acquired no fantastic that's some great clarity there so you know you were talking about pitching so what's our average retainers like how much do we charge uh a client here in Mumbai or across the country okay so minimum retainership across Services starts about 3 lakh rupees a month okay and goes up to let's say 18 to 20 lakh rupees a month okay and then the size of the team that is put into that differs between each of these pricing fantastic of many verticals that you have which is the vertical that gives you the maximum Revenue so in terms of uh in terms of absolute gross revenue it would be our digital creative Services which give us a maximum you know revenue and I'm counting uh Revenue that stays in with us okay let's break it down this way in terms of maximum gross revenue it is a media buying and planning business because we are buying and planning space for clients on Google Facebook programmatic what have you so that's the highest volume highest in terms of net volume is our uh digital creative business so that is uh when I mean net is uh net of third party costs what stays at home so that's the highest is the digital creative business and the highest margin is on our Tech business wow okay super um so shabang recently tied up with masu minawala for starting shabang maximiz how is this talent management initiative different from others uh so you know coming back to your to the point which we spoke about niches I I could connect to that point specific niches that we are going in with talent management one is we are very very clear on luxury and on super premium because masum minala comes with"
