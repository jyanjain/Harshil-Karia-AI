That comes down to the small things the right tags, the right timing, knowing exactly who you‚Äôre talking to. And honestly, that kind of instinct only comes from doing the work, over time. That‚Äôs when the gap became clear. There‚Äôs no real system that connects what you put into the creative with how it performs. Everyone‚Äôs either guessing or testing endlessly. That‚Äôs where Advize entered the equation, An AI-driven Creative Analytics Dashboard. Here‚Äôs what it does: ‚Ä¢ It tags every ad automatically using actual industry learning ‚Ä¢ It tells you what‚Äôs working, what‚Äôs not, and why ‚Ä¢ It saves you from running 20 variations just to get one right ‚Ä¢ It cuts out the manual work and speeds up decisions It‚Äôs already brought down media and creative analysis costs by nearly 70%. It spots what‚Äôs underperforming before it drains the budget. And you don‚Äôt need a big team to get answers anymore. A truly ingenious solution in the way Devarsh Bhupatkar has thought about it. Grateful that Sohil Karia and I got to be a small part of it. Comment ‚ÄúAI Tool‚Äù below to get a free test run of this solution..."

The disconnect between knowledge holders and seekers creates real problems: - Retailers struggle to explain products - Valuable insights stay locked in archives - Tool users make avoidable mistakes EasyConnect is an app by Stanley Black & Decker India that bridges this gap with: - Direct customer support - Tutorial videos - Special deals - Warranty management - Product catalogs By connecting manufacturers, retailers, and end-users, the app transforms isolated information into practical knowledge. A retailer discovers selling techniques. A user gains professional skills that once required years to develop.

Schbang proudly led the creative thinking behind how this was taken to market. There was nothing flashy about the campaign, and that‚Äôs why I believe it worked. A 4,000+ km journey powered by public charging infra, designed not to impress, but to hold up to scrutiny. It went on to be recognised by the World book of Records, India Book of Records and Asia Book of Records. What stood out to me wasn‚Äôt just the scale, but the thinking behind it. Using the journey as proof. Using street plays and local stops to make it feel personal. No over-the-top gimmicks, no noise - just clarity of purpose. This is what creative looks like when it‚Äôs grounded in first principles."

I was on a panel recently with Ganeshprasad S from Think School ¬Æ and Viraj Sheth from Monk Entertainment and we were asked about censorship and restraint‚Äîespecially in the wake of recent controversies. The big question was: Will influencers now be more careful about what they say? It got me thinking about the stark contrast between India and the US. In the US, you have two of the most powerful personalities: Elon Musk and Donald Trump‚Äîwho shoot off the most controversial statements one after the other, without batting an eyelid. They thrive on risky discourse. And somehow, it works for them. In India? An influencer cracks a poor joke, and it‚Äôs an uproar. Cancel culture kicks in almost immediately. I don‚Äôt know what the right balance is. But here‚Äôs what I do think‚Äîshock and awe is what gets you noticed in today‚Äôs media narrative. If Musk and Trump are anything to go by, it seems like you can say what you want and not be too afraid of the fallout. But India isn‚Äôt the US. The Indian public is far less forgiving and way more attuned to cancel culture. Or maybe it‚Äôs the other way around‚Äîhas cancel culture in the US become so overrated and pass√© that it barely matters anymore? Have we reached a point where the people doing the canceling are now considered irrelevant? I‚Äôm honestly not sure. So what‚Äôs the future for Indian media and its opinion makers? Is it controversy that drives the conversation, or is restraint going to shape discourse? Would love to hear your thoughts. hashtag # IndianMedia hashtag # Creator hashtag # CancelCulture"

      "content": "India vs Pakistan: What the Advertisers Told Us About Consumer Sentiment The game yesterday wasn‚Äôt just about cricket‚Äîit was a snapshot of where brands think India is heading, and it raised some interesting questions about consumer sentiment. You had the traditional big boys‚ÄîAramco, DP World, and Emirates‚Äîinvesting in long-term brand equity. No surprises there. But then, there were some curveballs. Livebhagwan advertising during the match was a bold move, likely riding the Kumbh Mela wave. While it signals a growing trend in spirituality, I‚Äôm not fully convinced it indicates increased discretionary spending on live poojas. Hotstar also advertised their Maha Shivratri special, showing that spirituality is becoming mainstream. We saw some return from the Crypto trading platforms. Irrationality is creeping back in Dream11, as expected, continues to drive revenue through cricket betting. Groww went big, promoting its India‚Äôs No. 1 stockbroker claim. ICICI Bank‚Äôs sharp ads and the classic Mutual Fund Sahi Hai campaign with Sachin, Dhoni, and Rohit show a clear bet on Indians investing more. Visa also advertised with Vicky Kaushal, pushing a premium product to a mass audience, signaling optimism. FMCG was not as visible‚Äîbarring Coke and Domino‚Äôs. That‚Äôs telling. It hints that FMCG is playing it safe, maybe post a rough patch. QComm was not as visible. Perhaps post IPO rationality is in. We did see Vimal Zubaan Kesari on repeat. Then there were the outliers.A tiles player going all out on marketing? Interesting Shows a new category developing.Roff was watching this closely. Auto ancillaries like CEAT Tyres were consistent with cricket ads, but the creative felt flat‚Äîare they maximizing their media spend? Mobil1 featured Hrithik Roshan, and Castrol signed SRK. With more cars on the road, the premiumization of the Indian consumer is clear. So, what does this all mean? There‚Äôs a growing bet on discretionary spends - but its a lot more tempered than we have seen in the past. Financial services are banking on consumer optimism. Optimism in investment in stocks and mutual funds as an asset class. FMCG is cautious‚Äîmaybe waiting for clearer signs of growth. Startups and newer players are getting bold again, signaling loosened cash flows. The spiritual sector was an interesting anomaly, and the return of crypto highlights the growing mood of irrationality in investing. It felt like an 80-20 split: 20% of ads seemed like burn, 80% were solid, long-term plays. Aggressive ad spending from funded companies could signal shifts in the labor market‚Äîhigher discretionary spends may lead to changes, especially for senior talent. The bigger question is‚Äîare we entering a phase of high-risk, high-reward marketing again? Or will we see a more rational approach as the year unfolds? I hope the market takes the route of caution (but irrational exuberance always has a way of showing up) Curious to hear your takes. What stood out to you? Did i miss some brands?"

My bet - this match had atleast 25 Cr. unique viewers. That's the ability to influence 16% of the country. And close to 50% of Digital India. Mass viewership and influence opportunities to ramp up are increasing - whether it's tweaks to the Meta products, the options available on some scalable Google inventory or opportunities like this one.

Over the years, their journey has been remarkable‚Äîshifting focus from consumer business to scaling up their B2B operations. They manage 22,000 people. What I truly admire about them is something much deeper. They have raised the standard of living for thousands of people across India‚Äîparticularly for blue-collared workers. They‚Äôve given them dignity, respect, care, and love, ensuring that those who support us every day are uplifted in their own lives. Inspired by this ethos, this film was conceptualized. Too often, we unknowingly use disrespectful terms for those who serve us. One such term is \"Kachrawala\"‚Äîa word that wrongly implies that these individuals create waste, rather than manage it. This film aims to change that perception. They don‚Äôt keep the waste; they keep the home. Beautifully written by Mohammed Sadriwala and brought to life by Schbang Motion Pictures, this is a tribute to those who ensure our spaces remain clean, yet often go unrecognized. Would love to hear your thoughts on this.

For many of these students, this is their first step toward rediscovering their potential - breaking barriers, embracing technology, and envisioning a brighter future. In just two sessions - Content Creation and Artificial Intelligence - students have: ‚Ä¢\tCreated their first-ever reels and launched their own Instagram pages, ‚Ä¢\tBegun identifying their niches and building their personal narratives, ‚Ä¢\tExplored tools like HeyGen to craft dynamic content, ‚Ä¢\tAnd developed their first websites using AI, unlocking new possibilities. Many of these students are school dropouts. For the girls, societal norms and parental restrictions have often kept them from pursuing education further. For the boys, financial struggles have pushed them to prioritize earning over learning, believing it to be the only way to support their families. Despite these challenges, their determination to grow and learn has been truly inspiring. This program is more than skill-building; it is about empowering individuals to rewrite their stories and break free from the challenges holding them back. At the Greater Good Foundation, we are building a future where these stories become catalysts for lasting change. This is the power of opportunity, resilience, and the belief in a better tomorrow."

The campaign also highlighted that India has a strong law in place to punish such offenders. However, awareness of the POCSO Act and its association with child sexual abuse is low. To address this, hashtag # ProtectedByPOCSO was crafted.

      "content": "To make an impact in cricket, you need Balls; some that break stumps, and the others, boundaries. At 19, Harmanpreet Kaur hit a six so powerful against Australia that it triggered a drug test. Why? Because no one believed a girl could hit that hard. Today, she‚Äôs the captain of the Indian cricket team, and that was just the start. She‚Äôs gone on to shatter records, inspire a generation, and redefine what it means to be a cricketer. For too long, sport has been viewed through a narrow lens‚Äîseen as the arena of men, where physical strength reigns supreme. But true athletes, know that it‚Äôs about so much more. It‚Äôs about heart. It‚Äôs about resilience. It‚Äôs about fighting through the noise, the doubt, and showing the world what you‚Äôre made of. And no one embodies that spirit better than our women cricketers. At Schbangalore we conceptualised this campaign with a lot of thought into the copy and research and built this campaign in collaboration with PUMA. All Credit to PUMA India and their In House Creative Team for producing this idea that set out to shift the conversation‚Äîfrom the tired stereotypes and token gestures around ‚Äúballs‚Äù to a true celebration of passion, and mastery. To make it to the bleeding edge of international cricket, these women needed balls. Thousands of them. Mastered to perfection. The ones that shatter, smash, trick or challenge. The ones that demand a dance at the boundary line before you secure them. The ones that can flip the script on a match, a series, or even a whole career. The ones that inspire a billion prayers. The ones that vanish into thin air. And the lucky few that make it to a fan's home with a smile. So the next time you hear the word, you‚Äôll know exactly what NOT to think of. For all of us who thought it takes just a pair of them, sorry to disappoint. Now, the truth: For true cricketing glory, you need balls - at least a few hundreds of them.. And while the road may have ended sooner than we hoped this ICC Women‚Äôs T20 World Cup, the fight, the passion, and the brilliance our team showed deserves nothing less than celebration. This journey is far from over, and their resilience has already won hearts. BTW It took Arundhati Reddy only 24 balls to deliver an exceptional performance in India's crucial win over Pakistan, with a match-winning spell of 3 wickets for just 19 runs. This was just 1 of the many winning performances we saw this World Cup. Kudos to PUMA India for Championing Cricket for Everyone in India and consistently backing idea after idea and initiative after initiative to ensure that hashtag # CricketIsEveryonesGame hashtag # PUMA hashtag # WomenInSports hashtag # Schbang"

      "content": "150% revenue growth from Retention Marketing üìà ‚Äîa testament to how the right strategies can transform business outcomes at Level SuperMind ! Here‚Äôs how we achieved this: ‚ùå What We Were Lacking: Initially, we didn‚Äôt have structured user journeys in place. There were no clear buckets for onboarding, activation, retention, or revenue generation, which meant we couldn‚Äôt guide users effectively through their experience on the app. ‚úÖ What We Did Right: 1. Bucket System: We developed 11-12 meaningful user journeys to ensure every new user was placed into the right bucket‚Äîwhether it was onboarding, activity completion, or in-app purchases (IAPs). The goal was to transition users from one bucket to the next, ultimately converting them into paying customers. 2. AI Notification Reminders: This was a game-changer for us! Personalized notifications from our coaches led to a 17% CTR, compared to the typical 1-2%. These AI-powered reminders alone contributed to 30% of our total revenue for the quarter. 3. Subtle Nudge Emails: Instead of pushing for sales outright, we used subtle nudges in our emails‚Äîhighlighting the benefits of upgrading to premium with a simple ‚ÄúUpgrade Now‚Äù button. This small change brought a steady increase in revenue without being intrusive. 4. Gifting as a Revenue Stream: For our premium users, we introduced the option to gift subscriptions to friends. This not only increased revenue but also boosted engagement and loyalty. üí° Key Learnings: - Motivational Messaging: Notifications based on motivation and appreciation performed far better than those based on guilt or fear. Positive reinforcement led to stronger engagement. - AI Timing Optimization: By using AI to send notifications at the precise times users were most likely to engage, we saw a significant increase in CTR and activity completion. - These changes helped us build a user-centric, data-driven retention strategy that not only enhanced user engagement but also drove significant revenue growth. hashtag # RetentionMarketing hashtag # AIGrowth hashtag # UserJourneys hashtag # CustomerEngagement hashtag # LevelSupermind hashtag # RevenueGrowth"

One thing is clear: if brands want to win on social, they need to speak the language of Reels.

For brands to truly hit their goals, they need to think and act like content creators, constantly finding new ways to hack the algorithm. But here‚Äôs the catch‚Äîour advertising and marketing media hasn‚Äôt fully caught on yet. The focus is still on static posts because they‚Äôre easier to feature as carousels. Meanwhile, Reels that are racking up millions of views are often overlooked, especially on social pages.

From paper tissue boxes to ceramic mugs, this AI-powered tool scans everyday items and calculates their environmental footprint. And guess what? A simple paper tissue box has a minimum environmental price of 2 years. üòÆ This tool is set to roll out across India, helping some of the country‚Äôs biggest operators like airports and malls take responsibility for their environmental footprint. It‚Äôs incredible to think about the impact this could have‚Äîthis is where real change begins. Stay tuned because we‚Äôre about to release the Beta ‚Äî and if you want to be one of the first to get your hands on it, comment below!

But sometimes, the best way to grab attention is by flipping the narrative. Our team at Schbang , in collaboration with NueGo , did just that with the bold statement: ‚ÄòEVs are BAD.‚Äô But, BAD for what? BAD for smog, BAD for carbon emissions, BAD for noise pollution. While everyone talks about how good EVs are, we chose to focus on how they're bad‚Äîbut for all the right reasons. This creative offers a fresh perspective, taking viewers on a thought-provoking journey through the environmental and societal benefits of EVs. It‚Äôs a twist that makes you stop, think, and see the advantages in a whole new light. A big shoutout to Tanmay More from our solutions team for coming up with this concept, perfectly brought to life by Manasi Deorukhkar 's sharp design execution. The client loved it‚Äîand so did the industry! Amit Bhatt , a leading voice in the green energy sector, even featured our post. Seeing experts share and amplify our work is incredibly rewarding. hashtag # Schbang hashtag # NueGo hashtag # EVs hashtag # GreenEnergy hashtag # Sustainability hashtag # Creativity hashtag # Innovation hashtag # Teamwork"

      "content": "Do Not Make This Leadership Mistake! Early in my career, I had a rough approach with my team. I‚Äôd use swear words, harsh language, and critical judgments often thinking that pushing people to their limits would bring out their best. My intent was to drive performance, but the reality was far different. Instead of motivating my team, it often had the opposite effect. Over time, I learned that there's a difference between being abusive and being firm. If you're not firm, you risk being taken for a ride‚Äîboundaries get crossed, and outcomes aren't met. But firmness doesn't mean harshness. You can be firm while being gentle, with clear plans of action, specific KPIs, and measurable expectations. Reflecting on my past behaviour, I realized I was mimicking a role model I admired. This person was successful and had a similar approach of being abusive with their team. Sometimes the abusive nature was borderline funny. Almost Ari Gold esque. Because I looked up to this role model, I didn‚Äôt fully consider the impact of my behaviour. I just replicated it, assuming it was the recipe for success. Someone so good is doing it ‚Äì how wrong can I go? This experience taught me an important lesson about leadership: we must be very mindful of how we carry ourselves in public. Whether we realize it or not, as leaders, we are magnets for behavior modeling. Our actions and words are easily replicated by those who look up to us. When we admire someone, we often overlook rational checks and simply mirror their behavior, assuming it leads to success. So, if you see yourself as a leader, be doubly, triply careful. As Spiderman says, \"With great power comes great responsibility.\" Let‚Äôs be mindful of the example we set, knowing that our behavior can significantly influence those around us. hashtag # Leadership hashtag # PublicBehavior hashtag # TeamManagement hashtag # PersonalReflection hashtag # GrowthMindset hashtag # PositiveLeadership hashtag # WorkplaceCulture hashtag # LeadingByExample"

Our recent campaign with Domino's shows how even a small social media feature can drive big engagement and build strong connections. During the IPL season we used Instagram 's \"Close Friends\" feature by inviting followers to join Domino's close friends list and that brought the feeling of curiosity and fear of missing out in the audience. Followers were invited to comment on a mid-day post to join our Close Friends Pizza Party and be a part of the brand‚Äôs close friends list. What was in it for our followers turned close friends? Exclusive discounts you probably won‚Äôt find anywhere else to enjoy Match Day with India‚Äôs favourite Pizza brand.

      "content": "It's been 5 yrs of cycling and I wanted to share the gifts its given me A Shift in Routine: My journey into cycling began with a simple realization: commuting by car meant I was constantly connected, not to my thoughts, but to incessant calls and emails. This digital overload prompted me to switch to a foldable bicycle, transforming my commute into a digital detox zone. On my bike, I'm finally off the phone and in tune with my thoughts. Integrating Cycling into Daily Life: The practicality of a foldable bike fits seamlessly into my urban lifestyle. Whether it's a meeting nearby or across the city, my bike folds and comes along in the car, cab, or even on the train, ensuring I can maintain this healthy practice regardless of my destination. Each day, this transition grants me at least 30 minutes of undisturbed time‚Äîprecious minutes where I'm alone with my thoughts, disconnected from digital distractions. Productivity and Punctuality: One surprising benefit has been how cycling has optimized my time management. In city traffic, a drive home could unpredictably stretch to 45 minutes, but my bike ride is a consistent 15 minutes‚Äîrain or shine. This reliability means I'm never late, always energized, and significantly more productive after having cleared my head with a brisk ride. A Vision for Urban Mobility: Cycling has reshaped my view on urban living. It's become a personal mission to advocate for more bike-friendly cities. Imagine a place where cycling is not just possible but encouraged, enhancing the quality of life for everyone. This vision drives me to push for infrastructure changes that support sustainable, healthy urban environments. Five years into this journey, I've seen firsthand the profound impact cycling can have on a personal and professional level. It‚Äôs more than a mode of transport; it‚Äôs a pathway to better health, sharper thinking, and greater productivity. I share this story to inspire more of you to consider how such a simple change can lead to significant improvements in your work and well-being. What small changes in your daily routine have impacted your day positively? hashtag # cycling hashtag # productivity"

On August 23, 2023, as Chandrayaan-3 successfully landed on the Moon, our team at Schbang had the privilege of working on a creative project that perfectly encapsulated the nation's pride. Inspired by this historic achievement, the idea for the Happydent campaign emerged from our team. With unwavering dedication, we turned the design around in the matter of a few hours, capturing the essence of the moment flawlessly. The very next day, this moment was discussed at a Storyboard event by the legendary director Ram Madhvani, who created the iconic Muskuraley commercial. Hearing him talk about the work was a testament to it's depth and quality. hashtag # Throwback hashtag # Schbang hashtag # Happydent hashtag # Chandrayaan3 hashtag # ProudMoment hashtag # CreativeJourney"
